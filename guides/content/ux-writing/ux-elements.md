##### Label elements with action verbs

Users should be able to tell what an interactive element (e.g., button, icon, etc.) does at a glance. Use action verbs to clearly label what the element does does.

**Do:** Connect, Send, Subscribe

**Don't:** Okay, Submit

See [UI Copy: Remove vs. Delete](https://uxmag.com/articles/ui-copy-remove-vs-delete2) for more information. Some examples from the article are included below.

##### Use hyperlink text

**When to use:** Great for users who want to dig deeper. May be used on their own or embedded in the above options.

**How to use:**

-   Use link text that describes the site's purpose and destination.

-   If you are linking to something from an image or icon, supply an alt text attribute to give people who use screen readers some context.

-   Open the link in a new tab, and indicate that it'll open in a new tab.

-   Underline and use blue text (#00aeff or color variable \$blue).

**Do:** Read about infection rate on the [CDC COVID Data Tracker site](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home) (opens in new tab).

##### Use graphics to communicate

Human beings are incredibly visual. An ability to interpret visual information is hard-wired into our brains. In some contexts, it might be nearly impossible to say something in words. That's where imagery can support us and make text comprehensible.

**Do:** Use graphics when they communicate the answer better than words. Example from [16 Rules of Effective UXÂ Writing (babich.biz)](https://babich.biz/ux-writing/).

**Don't:** Configure, Manage, Yes, No, etc.
