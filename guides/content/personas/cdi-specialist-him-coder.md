## Pain Points

-   If I am unable to gain additional detail from the physician that is missing from the patients' record, there can be errors in the bill and inaccurate information thus causing discrepancies in billing.
-   If I am unable to capture a higher level of specificity to match exactly the services the patient received in the hospital, our organization won't be able to bill the highest amount.
-   If I am unable to find the correct codes given then situation, then errors will occur in billing and I will have to spend extra time trying to identify correction.
-   If I am unable to find the correct modifiers when they are needed, then corrections will do missed causing a domino chain of errors in billing.
