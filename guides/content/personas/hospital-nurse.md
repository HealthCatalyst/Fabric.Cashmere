# Jessie Rashmi

*"I love getting alerts and patient information—and being able to contact staff all in the same place."*

<br>

Jessie must quickly and efficiently shift priorities based on overall patient load, changes to individual patient acuity, staffing, and planned and unplanned procedures. He is a good communicator with clinical and non-clinical staff, as well as with patients and their families, interacting successfully with healthcare teams and de-escalating conflict when needed. He has a basic knowledge of disease processes, medications, and procedures. He stays aware of patients’ physiological, psychosocial, and mental health needs.

## Goals

-   Ensure that all patients receive their medications and other treatments on time
-   Educate patients on a healthy lifestyle (medications, nutrition, exercise, durable medical equipment), and observe the patient putting the education into action
-   Make sure each patient and family feels like they are getting the care and attention they need
-   Organize the day to finish shift on time
-   Complete all tasks; don’t leave a lot of extra work for the next shift
-   Ensure that patients are discharged in a timely manner so that waiting patients can use the beds
-   Easily see and communicate each patient’s plan of care
-   Seamlessly capture data during routine provision of care (document once versus many times) in order to focus more on patient care

## Needs

-   Locate patient records in one place
-   Communicate with healthcare team efficiently so that all primary team members are kept informed
-   Spend less time recording large amounts of information and completing documentation—and more time with patients
-   Accurate medication reconciliation/medication management
-   Consistent documentation methods among all nurses
-   Visibility into what is missing or what hasn’t been done, particularly around documentation
