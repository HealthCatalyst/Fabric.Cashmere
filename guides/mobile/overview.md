##### How to use this guide

These documents are meant to give you a brief overview of how to get started building a new mobile interface for your web application or improve the user experience of an existing mobile web UI. Think of it as being more of a *cheat sheet* than a comprehensive guide. In here, you’ll find our list of best practices for building or improving your web application’s mobile user interface, along with recommendations about where to look for more information.

For our purposes, we will be using the terms mobile web application development and responsive web design interchangeably.
