### Network Administrator

</div>

</div>

---

## Role

-   Monthly
-   Technical Level â€“ High

---

## Responsibilities

-   Extremely technical
-   Several competing IT projects going on simultaneously with many ad hoc requests that arise regularly
-   I am the only IT expert onsite at all times to handle any IT-related issues so I can't spend a lot of time on anything that is not a top priority

---

## Pain Points

-   If I am unable to protect PHI, the hospital will be at risk for a HIPPA violation and subject to possible fines.
-   I must have a specific set of data returned to me to update the system automatically so that I don't have to do anything manually (integration) or billings will not go out the door with the most accurate information.
-   I need to be able to set up a job that will send data to an SFTP automatically (Automated data Transfer) or the most recent data will not be available for use leading to inaccurate reporting and delayed workflow processes.
