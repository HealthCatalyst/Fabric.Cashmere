# Margaret Haugen

### Medical Doctor

Dr. Haugen frequently monitors data on quality, safety, appropriateness, and overutilization of care for her facility and/or department. When there is a worsening outcome, she activates her team to do a root-cause analysis and design an intervention. She also works to ensure that best-practice guidelines are followed and educates team members on new processes, including winning buy-in from fellow physicians. A physician with high credibility among her peers and direct, ongoing patient care experience, she also has acquired QI and process improvement skills and experience.
