# Ian Huang

### Analytic Services Organization

Ian combines deep, analytics skills and a sound understanding of the processes and data that support the business of healthcare to inform a fundamental transformation of healthcare delivery. His primary accountability is to ensure that there is always a queue of measurable opportunities to act on that will drive down cost, improve quality, and improve patient experience.

**Note:** This Health Catalyst persona is similar to the client [BI Developer](/content/personas/bi-developer) and often works closely with that team member—he may train the BI Developer to continue development of the deliverable (e.g., to continue development of an app).

## Goals

-   Determine project requirements through project analysis and consultation with project stakeholders and sponsors (based on decisions made to date)
-   Determine the optimal solution to solve the stated problem (consulting, reports, analytic accelerator, etc.)
-   Translate system and stakeholder requirements into functional technical specifications and, ultimately, a deliverable
-   Understand and make smart decisions about Health Catalyst tools (shared data marts, measures, etc.) and resources (SMEs, data science, etc.) to reduce time to improvement and provide users with the optimal end experience
    -   Advocate for these tools within the healthcare organizations they work with
    -   Help customers become self-sufficient in working with these applications
-   Develop solutions in collaboration with Health Catalyst and client team members in an iterative process
-   Thoroughly validate the solution (for accuracy, functionality, completeness, etc.)
-   Present analytic insights to clinical/operational/financial leadership
-   Coach clients on how to use the right data to communicate effectively
-   Provide ongoing support for escalated Health Catalyst application issues
-   Keep up with the rapid pace of work (which means sometimes I walk the line between moving fast vs. implementing "best practices" that are time consuming, like creating indexes)
-   Help client [BI Developer](/content/personas/bi-developer) or [Clinical/Quality Data Analyst](/content/personas/clinical-quality-data-analyst) build SAMs and educate them on SAM architecture
