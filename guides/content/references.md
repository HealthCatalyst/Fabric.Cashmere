##### How to Ensure Sources are Credible

It is important to gauge the credibility of any book, article, report, or website you cite as a source. Follow these guidelines to evaluate your sources:
1. Above all, consider credibility. Cite a government website, a well-known organization, or mainstream media outlet before any other source. Be sure the information is on the main page of a current website (outdated information might live in locations other than the main, current URL). 
2. Avoid citing Wikipedia, a dictionary, or an encyclopedia. These may be good starting places for research, but they do nothing to add credibility because they are often secondary sources of information.
3. Do not cite other vendors.

##### What Style to Use

Use a modified [American Psychological Association (APA)](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples) style for most references.

**HCAT Modifications to APA:**
 - Delete the month/day after the author(s) and add “Retrieved from”    before the URL.
 - If there are three or more authors, list only the first followed by "et al." (e.g., “Asselah T. et al.”). If there are only two, list both (“Asselah, T. & Durantel, D.”).
 - Replace any DOI with the source URL (a DOI or digital object identifier is a string of characters used by the APA to permanently identify an article or document and link to it on the web; not all sources will have a DOI).

Exceptions:
- **For internal-only content**, you can limit the citation to just what's needed to find the source (e.g., article title and link).
- **For web content**, hyperlink to the source. Use the name of the publication or website as the hypertext ([Insights](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/knowledge-center/insights/) on [healthcatalyst.com](healthcatalyst.com) uses this convention).
