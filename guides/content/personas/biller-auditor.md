---

## Role

-   Daily User
-   Technical Level â€“ Low


---

## Responsibilities

-   Reviews Codes to ensure accuracy
-   Identifies opportunities to improve coding/billing activities
-   Sends claims to clearinghouses or insurance companies and bills the difference to the patient


---

## Pain Points

-   If I don't send out accurate bills, there will be a delay in the payment received and our organization will endure financial strains due to these delays.
-   If every bill is not accurately coded correctly, I will face collection and have to rebill claims, causing many delays in receiving payment and in some cases causing our organization not to receive any payment on a claim, creating a major financial strain on the entire hospital.
