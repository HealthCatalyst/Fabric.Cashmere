<h5 id="form-field-text-formatting">Form Field Text Formatting</h5>
<p>For both the labels and contents of form fields, please use the following formatting:</p>
<p>Capitalize first word only, except in cases where the selection is an actual program name or proper name (e.g. Patient non-adherence or challenges in care management; Duplicate patient; Algorithm incorrect; Comprehensive HIV AIDS Management Program (CHAMP), Grace Program, LSU Diabetes, Salt Lake City, etc.).</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h5 id="form-field-labels">Form Field Labels</h5>
<p>Use a colon at the end of form field labels (e.g. Email address:). A colon implies a direct connection between the label text and a particular control or set of controls. The only situation where a colon should not be used is when the label and control work together to form a single sentence.</p>
