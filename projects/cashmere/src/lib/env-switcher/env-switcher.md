##### Metadata Environment Switcher

The metadata environment switcher (`<hc-env-switcher>`) is a component that can live in the navbar. It allows Catalyst applications to share a common experience for switching across environments within an application. The component is designed to work with environments retrieved from Metadata Service (MDS). As environment(s) are selected, it is up to the developer of each application to apply the appropriate headers for actually operating within the
selected environment. For more information about working with metadata environments, consult the [DOS documentation](https://docs.healthcatalyst.com/).
