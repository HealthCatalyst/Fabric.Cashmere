<h5 id="tile-overview">Tile Overview</h5>
<p>Tiles are a common UI element that you can use to segment content on your page. The Cashmere tile is white with a drop-shadow, so it is most effective on a light gray background - most commonly <code>$slate-gray-100</code>. Tiles can be both large or small - as content containers, or even as draggable elements within a list.</p>

<h5 id="tile-headers">Tile Headers</h5>
<p>Cashmere includes a few common header types often used in applications.  To use the headers, include the <code>hcTileHeader</code> directive on an HTML element. Below are some guidelines around usage of the available headers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>blue</strong> - this is the tile header used around this Cashmere site; it's particularly effective for content containers where the tiles are being used to segment the layout. It's blue and uppercase, so it stands more as a design element and tends to get out of the way of the primary content on the tile.</li>
<li><strong>title</strong> - this is an all purpose header that will inherit the color of its parent. It can be used in a number of situations from sidebars to lists.</li>
<li><strong>center</strong> - this header type is often used on dashboards or menus where the tiles are small and contain a specific piece of information. As in the example, it is often used with an icon above the header text, and a description line below. Uses include: a headline metric, a link to specific page, or settings for a particular type of content.</li>
</ul>
