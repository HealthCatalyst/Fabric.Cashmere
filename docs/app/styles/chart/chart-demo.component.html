        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>Entire bookshelves could be filled with all that has been written about best practices for data visualization.
            The styles presented here don't seek to rewrite any of those books, but instead are primarily aimed at maximizing
            readability and consistency in our charts.  But if you are looking for an excellent, no-nonsense guide for improving
            your visualizations, we highly recommend Scott Berinato's <a href="http://a.co/9uDIcKr" target="blank">Good Charts</a>.</p>
