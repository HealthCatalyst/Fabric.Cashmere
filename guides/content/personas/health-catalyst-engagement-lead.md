### Senior Director of Client Engagement

The EL has primary accountability for the success of our client engagements. Success is defined in several ways; client satisfaction with our products and services, the number of outcomes improvements the client achieves, increased longevity of the clientâ€™s partnership with Health Catalyst, and profitability for Health Catalyst. This position is responsible for helping clients become self-sufficient in transformational change while continuing to support, augment, and share new knowledge as it comes available. This position serves as a visible leader of our strong commitment to continuous improvement; the Health Catalyst operating principles, cultural attributes, and mission; and the assurance that these attributes are upheld by all client-facing resources contributing to the client engagement.
