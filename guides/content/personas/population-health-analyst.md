### Population Health Analyst

She has experience and expertise with analytics tools and data from one or more domains (financial+). She's a consumer and creator of business intelligence reports that show the organization's financial and quality performance and that ultimately enable outcomes improvement. Her workflow may begin with questions or requests from upper management or work teams—but self-driven hypotheses or data-scanning will also initiate analysis.

## Goals

-   Find opportunities to improve care and lower costs across the care continuum
-   Collaborate with SMEs and leaders across traditional organizational boundaries to validate insights, maintain focus on areas/outcomes of interest (i.e., those that serve current PHM strategy)
-   Clearly communicate data discoveries (outcome or process)
-   Transforms data analysis into recommendations by modeling the potential impact of data findings on the organization's performance
-   Integrate latest domain/industry research/ trends and SME input into analytics and tested hypotheses

---

## Needs

-   Access data and analytics (benchmarks, variation, trends)  to identify care gaps, over- or under-utilization, areas of under-performance, etc.
-   Drill into specific cases to find enough details to investigate further, or link to where she can find that information
-   Access multiple tools to analyze, digest, and communicate information (Excel, BI visualization tool, etc.)
-   Access domain experts and appropriate clinical and financial direction and data
-   For process improvement work: Measure outcomes of specific interventions over time (exactly what the hospital system is undertaking); ability to:
    -   Capture the date of intervention start—and then track different metrics from that point
    -   Answer: Have we decreased variation and made significant difference in a specific metric, outcome, or process aim from target?
    -   Attribute the impact to the intervention
