##### Writing for all abilities

-   Put the person first, e.g., use person with a disability, not disabled person.

-   Use brief, meaningful, focused text, following the guidelines in [UX Content Principles and Guidelines]{.underline}.

-   Consider screen readers. Avoid special characters (&, +, \~, etc.), which screen readers can misread.

##### Alt text
