### Technical Director

Kiri develops and executes strategies of implementing proprietary data warehousing solutions and manages expectations with dynamic timelines. As the first person to work with the client on a project (and often the last, since she's troubleshooting ongoing issues), Kiri has technical skills, interpersonal skills, and healthcare domain knowledge. She has the ability to handle complex challenges with a sensible approach in an ambiguous environment. Kiri has a deep understanding of the data in the data warehouses and how to make use of the data; concepts of many various data storage systems (e.g., Oracle, Mumps, TSql); the Catalyst platform; networking; SQL serverâ€”essentially, she needs to adapt to whatever system her client is using.
