They're built from three parts: A set of SCSS mixins defining the styles for the component, its sub-components, and different states the component can be in (like \"invalid\" or \"loading\"). A set of CSS classes that import the mixins and implement them in a default way. Cashmere components don't use view encapsulation, so these CSS classes are global. An Angular component, which includes HTML markup and basic functionality. The Angular component is not meant to fit every possible use case. Instead, it focuses on the most common, expected use cases. For example, Cashmere's button component includes various colors of buttons, link buttons, icon buttons, and split buttons, but if you want a floating action button or a button that changes its contents on hover, you'll have to build it yourself. The way components are built makes it easy to do that. You can opt in to the level of flexibility or convenience you need. From most flexible to most convenient: You can import the SCSS mixins and use them in a custom stylesheet for your own component, overriding rules as needed. You can import the component and use its CSS classes in the markup for your own component. You can import the component and use it as-is. All components in this documentation use the last method. For examples of the other two, see the repository cashmere-integration-examples. It includes a vanilla HTML site that uses Cashmere via CSS classes, and a Vue app that uses Cashmere via SCSS mixins.","link":"web/guides/using-customizing-components","category":"guides","displayName":"using-customizing-components","type":"doc","section":"components-overview"},{"id":"style_guidelines_for_new_components","title":"Style Guidelines For New Components - Using Customizing Components","content":"Style guidelines for new components All Cashmere components should meet the following expectations: The component stylesheet (e.g. button.component.scss) should not include any CSS rules. It should only have @import statements, CSS selectors, and @include statements. This ensures that all the component's styles can be used via mixins--none of them are bound to the component. CSS selectors in the component stylesheet should be prefixed with hc-{component name}-. Remember that component CSS is not view-encapsulated, so good prefixing helps us avoid style collisions. The mixin stylesheet (e.g. sass/button.scss) should not include any top-level CSS selectors. Each top-level item should be a mixin. The mixin stylesheet should not include any nested CSS selectors that would make confusing assumptions about the user's HTML structure. That is, the [disabled] attribute selector and pseudo-selectors like :hover or :after are okay, but class or tag names like .hc-checked and input should be avoided. Both stylesheets should be as flat as possible. Nesting CSS selectors in SCSS files creates extremely specific selectors which are hard to override. Cashmere should make it easy to override a style rule if needed. CSS classes can be added to component markup to avoid nesting. If nesting more than 2 levels deep is unavoidable, an overridable SCSS variable (with !default) can be added to the mixins file to allow the user to set the rule before importing the mixins.","link":"web/guides/using-customizing-components","category":"guides","displayName":"using-customizing-components","type":"doc","section":"style-guidelines-for-new-components"},{"id":"supported_browsers","title":"Supported Browsers - Supported Browsers","content":"Supported Browsers Last updated May 20, 2022","link":"web/guides/supported-browsers","category":"guides","displayName":"supported-browsers","type":"doc","section":"supported-browsers"},{"id":"browser_support_table","title":"Browser Support Table - Supported Browsers","content":"Browser support table To support a more unified and better user experience, Health Catalyst should aim to align the target browser compatibility.

Therefore, we take the following balanced approach for Angular versioning in Cashmere: Target: latest LTS version We plan to keep Cashmere up-to-date with the latest LTS version of Angular. This means that when an Angular version ends active support and enters LTS support (see Angular's Support Policy and Schedule), Cashmere will update its minimum supported version to that version.

Following the below steps can facilitate this. Open a terminal and run npm run build in the Cashmere root folder on your computer. This will put all the necessary files in the dist/cashmere directory. Note: Running only npm run build:lib will leave out some necessary files from this directory, so make sure to run the whole thing. Navigate to dist/cashmere and run npm link. This will set up a link to use your local build of Cashmere rather than the installed one from npm. Navigate to the root folder of the app you would like to test with your local Cashmere and run npm link @healthcatalyst/cashmere. This will tell your project to use the local cashmere rather than the installed one. Once this is complete, you should technically be good. A couple more tweaks that might have to be done: Sometimes, your project may find a conflict between the locally-installed rxjs (or other libraries) and the one bundled with Cashmere. In order to make sure you are using the version from your project, add the following two lines to the paths section in your root tsconfig.json: \"rxjs\": [\"node_modules/rxjs\"], \"rxjs/\": [\"node_modules/rxjs/\"] In order to help Angular to accept the symlinks added by npm link, add the following line to your angular.json (under projects -> {project} -> architect -> build -> options): \"preserveSymlinks\": true If you encounter other configuration tweaks needed to make it work in your app, please add it to this list to help others that may encounter the same problems.","link":"web/guides/linking-a-local-app-to-cashmere","category":"guides","displayName":"linking-a-local-app-to-cashmere","type":"doc","section":"setup-linking"},{"id":"getting_started","title":"Getting Started - Getting Started","content":"Getting Started Last updated Mar 20, 2025  Step 1: Install npm dependencies. A) Install Cashmere and the Angular CDK npm install --save @healthcatalyst/cashmere @angular/cdk B) (Optional) Install additional dependencies as needed. Noto Sans - Recommended font. Ng-select - Needed only if using the multiselect/typeahead component. Look here for which version of ng-select to install based on your Angular version. Ngx-slider - Needed only if using the slider component. npm install --save notosans-fontface @ng-select/ng-select @angular-slider/ngx-slider   Step 2: Create a Cashmere module. A) Create a module to hold the Cashmere components your app needs. This will make for a more organized code base and will help avoid duplicate references throughout your app. Place all the components in the exports field of the @NgModule annotation. import {NgModule} from '@angular/core'; import {BreadcrumbsModule, ButtonModule, CheckboxModule, IconModule} from '@healthcatalyst/cashmere'; @NgModule({ exports: [BreadcrumbsModule, ButtonModule, CheckboxModule, IconModule] }) export class CashmereModule {} B) Import the Cashmere module into your SharedModule. @NgModule({ imports: [CashmereModule], exports: [CommonModule, CashmereModule] }) export class SharedModule {} Anywhere you import the Shared module, Cashmere components will also be available.   Step 3: Add the styles. A) Import baseline Cashmere styles. The root Cashmere stylesheet needs to be imported in your app's global style sheet (src/styles.scss). @import \"@healthcatalyst/cashmere/scss/cashmere\"; B) (Optional) Add Font Awesome & Noto Sans. In angular.json, place references for each font in your project's build target options in the styles array. \"projects\": { \"\": { \"architect\": { \"build\": { \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\", \"options\": { \"styles\": [ \"./node_modules/notosans-fontface/css/notosans-fontface-allweight.css\", \"src/styles.scss\" // your app's global stylesheet ] } } } } } C) (Optional) Add Health Catalyst icons (hcicons2). If your app needs access to the Health Catalyst icon font, add the following to your app's global style sheet (src/styles.scss): @import \"@healthcatalyst/cashmere/hcicons2/hcicons2\"; Note: The recommended approach is to hand pick only needed icons and generate your own icon font, but direct reference as illustrated above is available as a fallback approach.","link":"web/guides/getting-started","category":"guides","displayName":"getting-started","type":"doc","section":"getting-started"},{"id":"creating_a_new_component","title":"Creating A New Component - Creating New Components","content":"Creating a New Component Last updated April 14, 2021","link":"web/guides/creating-new-components","category":"guides","displayName":"creating-new-components","type":"doc","section":"creating-a-new-component"},{"id":"overview","title":"Overview - Creating New Components","content":"Overview The Cashmere library is heavily built on its component-based architecture.

Code Documentation The API documentation for Cashmere is auto-generated directly from the TypeScript source using Dgeni (based on JSDoc). Be sure that all public components and modules are exported in the index.ts file of that component's directory. That will ensure that the documentation generator parses all included code. The following are best-practices to ensure the docs are generated correctly: Comment Formatting Comments should be begin with / followed by a space and end with a space, then /. If a comment spans multiple lines, each new line should begin with a space, ``, and another space. /** The navbar is a wrapper that positions branding, navigation, and other elements in a concise header. */ @Component({ ... }) What Comments to Include Add a comment above any @Component definitions that describe the function of the component Add a comment above @Input definitions describing the purpose and usage of the input as well as their default value Add a comment above any public functions describing the function and any parameters /* Fixes the position of navbar to the top of the page. Default is false.* */ @Input() fixedTop: boolean = false; Excluding Items from Docs Any component variables or functions that are meant only to be used internally and should not be included in the documentation should begin with an underscore in their name. _menuOpen: boolean = false; Usage Documentation In addition to the auto-generated API docs, a component may include an optional \"Usage\" section that describes additional information on configuring or working with the component. The usage page is written in markdown format and is included in the same directory as the component source. It should have the same name as the source file (e.g. select.md if the source is named select.component.ts). In the DocItem array in document-items.service.ts, the component should have its usageDoc flag set to true. Pull Requests Before you submit your pull request (PR), consider the following guidelines: Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort. Development happens on the dev branch and master is used to create a new release. From the dev branch create a new branch. Here is a good guide if you're just getting started. Verify all changes look and function properly in different browsers and at different resolutions. Run the following commands: npm run lint should result in All files pass linting If there are problems with prettier linting rules, running npm run prettier can be helpful. This will automatically make needed formatting changes based on our prettier rules. For Windows users, runs best in bash. npm run test:unit should result in All tests passing npm run build should pass and build the library successfully. New components and directives must be accompanied by: A component demonstrating the functionality; this component should be added to the demo app's routes. Unit tests demonstrating that it functions as intended. A new component should adhere to the Health Catalyst style.

(To help with creating commit messages you should use commitizen by running npm run cm when you want to commit) Commit Message Format Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject: (): The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional. Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters! This makes the message easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools. Revert If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert:, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit ., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted. Type Must be one of the following: feat: A new feature. fix: A bug fix. docs: Documentation only changes. style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc). refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature. perf: A code change that improves performance. test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests. build: Changes that affect the build system, CI configuration or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm). chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files. Scope The scope could be anything specifying the place of the commit change. For example button, dialog, etc. Subject The subject contains a succinct description of the change: use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\". don't capitalize first letter. no dot (.) at the end. Body Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior. Footer The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes. Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

Users should always know where they can go and how to get there. Within Cashmere, navigation components also constitute the central element of our branding. But translating the navigation of a desktop web app to smaller screens can be a challenge with limited visual real estate, and the need to prioritize content over navigation elements. The following navigation patterns are suggested for Cashmere applications. The UX is described below, and any setup required is included in the How to Use section. Priority Navigation Within the standard Cashmere navbar, a developer may add as many links as needed with no character limits on the names of those links. But there is no guarantee that a user will always be running the application in a browser window wide enough to display them all. Cashmere progressively trims the available navigation options before entirely collapsing the menu on the smallest screens. The navbar will automatically collect all navigation options that fall outside of the visible area into a \"More\" dropdown. Mobile Navigation More Menu The \"More\" menu will always collect the rightmost elements first, so care should be given to the ordering of items in your navbar. The highest priority, most-used items should be included first so they have the least chance of dropping into the \"More\" menu. Additionally, the Cashmere navbar supports developer-created dropdown menus. These can be used to create a leaner navbar and by grouping similar items together. Mobile Navigation Dropdown Hamburger Menu When the Cashmere navbar reaches the md breakpoint (visit the responsive breakpoints page for more information), the screen is small enough that the navigation experience needs to be further collapsed to optimize for the available space. At that point, all navigation links are collected into a \"hamburger\" menu – so called because the button to trigger the menu looks like a hamburger (if you’re feeling particularly hungry). The hamburger menu allows for a high degree of customization within Cashmere and gives the developer the freedom to decide what navigation items they would like to include for smaller screens. Hamburger Menu Although all the navigation links collapse to the hamburger menu, the app may still display a collection of navigation icons on the right side of the navbar. This is useful if the developer would like to preserve a few extremely high priority navigational elements outside of the hamburger menu (i.e. search, create new, settings, etc). Secondary Navigation Often pages of a web application feature secondary navigation to child pages. In a desktop environment, a user might use tabs or other UI elements to navigate to those child pages. In a small screen environment with limited horizontal real estate, a common pattern leveraged in Cashmere applications is to switch from tabs to a Select component in a Subnav for secondary navigation. The Select component serves both as a navigation control as well as an indicator of the current page. Mobile Secondary Navigation","link":"web/mobile/mobile-navigation","category":"guides","displayName":"mobile-navigation","type":"doc","section":"explanation"},{"id":"how_to_use","title":"How To Use - Mobile Navigation","content":"How to Use All ` and elements will automatically be collected into the \"More\" menu based on the browser width. However, in situations where links are added dynamically or triggered with *ngIf statements, the app may need to force the navbar to recalculate widths after all elements are finished rendering. To do so, include a reference to the navbar and call its associated refreshNavLinks()` function. Navbar Dropdowns To group navigation elements into a dropdown menu, use the `. As mentioned above, dropdown menus will automatically be collected into the \"More\" menu if they fall outside the bounds of the browser width. The content of a dropdown may be anything that would fit in a popover, but most typically it uses the hcMenu` directive: Finance Legal Clinical Hamburger Menu Unlike the \"More\" menu, the hamburger menu requires some setup. This was done intentionally to give the developer additional control over the options to be displayed in the menu and how they should be displayed. The hamburger menu is defined within the ` tag using the element. Navigation links are grouped using , and dividers between groups may added using `. Additionally, if the Cashmere app switcher is being used in the navbar, you may add the `` element to automatically populate the available apps from the app switcher. Home Oncology Surgery View on GitHub Secondary Navigation After the `, secondary navigation can be implemented using the and elements. The subnav typically has its fixedTop param set to true, and its display style is set to none until the md breakpoint is reached. To trigger page navigation, one option is to use a change event on the select control which calls the navigate() function of an Angular Router` object.

You can test the keyboard accessibility of your web application by clicking the mouse in your browser’s address bar, and then navigating using only the keyboard.

To the greatest extent possible, we want to take advantage of that and not introduce UI that breaks from familiar usage patterns on specific devices. Primarily this is done by leveraging standard HTML markup and form elements (`, `, etc). Cashmere components have taken this into account and follow this best practice. But as you are building unique elements and components in your app, think twice about incorporating novel UI using custom javascript or libraries. Even if they feature mobile support, their UX will be different from what users are familiar with on their device. Label Position The Cashmere ` defaults to positioning labels above the form field. Research suggests that this leads to faster form completion and easier scanning of a page. They do have the option to set inline to true which positions the label and form element on the same horizontal. If an app includes inline form fields, when hitting breakpoints for smaller screens a best practice is to switch to top labels (set inline to false`). It provides more screen real estate for longer labels and/or inputs. Form Field Labels Form Layout Beyond the form elements themselves, pay particular consideration to your form layout. If your forms include multiple columns, ensure that your flex display is set up correctly to wrap those elements into a single column on a smaller screen. You may also need to adjust the padding/margins in your form elements as the layout wraps into a single column.","link":"web/mobile/form-fields","category":"guides","displayName":"form-fields","type":"doc","section":"explanation"},{"id":"how_to_use","title":"How To Use - Form Fields","content":"How to Use One Cashmere form element that does require configuration for ideal mobile support is the Input directive.

The hcInput directive includes a mobile parameter that can be set to true to adjust the styling of inputs for smaller screens. It sets the font size to 16px so zooming won't be triggered when the control is activated. It's up to the app to set that parameter to true or false; the component doesn't have its own breakpoints.

Here are two examples of why deep linking in a web app is important: A user on a mobile phone is much more likely to have a spotty internet connection than a user on a desktop computer with a high-speed network connection. When that mobile internet connection fails to load a portion of your web app, the user may need to reload the entire page. If you use deep linking to provide the user with a persistent record of their location within your web app, the user will be able to resume their work without having to re-navigate through your web app. A user can share their location within the web app with a colleague and more easily collaborate on a work project.","link":"web/mobile/deep-linking","category":"guides","displayName":"deep-linking","type":"doc","section":"explanation"},{"id":"how_to_verify_support","title":"How To Verify Support - Deep Linking","content":"How to Verify Support For each page of your web app, try reloading the browser.

Developers can collect the SVGs needed for their app, generate a font, and then store & reference those assets in their code repository. </p> <p> We recommend including the following instructions in your client-side README.md. (Make sure to update the font name, abbrevations, and paths to suit your app.) </p> <hc-chip color=\"blue\" class=\"chip-note\"> <span class=\"chip-inner\"> <span class=\"hc-icon-left icon-bullhorn\"></span> <span>NOTE: The Cashmere library does not have a dependency on a specific icon font. All glyphs used in the components are encoded in the styles. This gives development teams the flexibility to use any icon set alongside Cashmere without conflict.</span> </span> </hc-chip> <pre><code> ## Icons We are using a custom icon font (`app-icons.ttf`) for our icon system. The svg icons that comprise this icon set are found in `path/to/svgs.` To use an icon, apply the `icon-[nameoficon]` class to an element, and that icon will be added to a `:before` psuedo element: ``` &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon-wrench&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt; ``` Available icons can be looked up in `path/to/generated/demo.html`. Never make a manual change to anything in `path/to/generated`, as those files are generated by the IcoMoon app. _**Note**: Only icons should ever use a class prefixed with \"icon-\". That prefix is the selector for applying the proper icon-font as the font-family for the element. That selector looks like this - `[class^=&quot;icon-&quot;], [class*=&quot; icon-&quot;] &#123; font-family: &#39;[icon-font-nm]&#39;; ... &#125;`_ ### Icon Helper Styles There are helper css styles for icons located in the `path/to/icons` directory. These files can be edited/added to as needed. A few examples of what is included there: - **Sizing classes**. `app-ico-lg`, `app-ico-sm` - **Spacing classes**. For example, use `icon-left` for an icon position on the left side of a button. Will add a bit of padding on the icon's right side. - **Animation classes**. `app-ico-spin` - **Transformation classes**. `app-ico-rotate-180`, `app-ico-flip-horizonatal` ### Adding New Icons To add an icon, follow this process: 1. Convert your new icon to an SVG file and add it to `path/to/svgs`. Make sure it is approved for use by the UX team. Icons from [FontAwesome version 6](https://fontawesome.com/icons) or [hc-icons](https://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/foundations/icons) are generally approved. 2. Visit https://icomoon.io/app/ and upload all of our icons from the `path/to/svgs` directory. 3. Select all the icons you've uploaded, and then click \"Generate Font.\" 4. On this next screen, click on the settings button (should be next to download button), and then do the following: 1. Enter \"app-icons\" for the font name. 2. Uncheck support for IE8 and lower. We aren't supporting these, so we'll simplify the code that's about to be generated. 3. Activate the option to generate SASS. 5. Click \"Download\". 6. Extract all files from the downloaded .zip. 7. Move the contents of the .zip to `path/to/generated` </code></pre> </hc-tile> <hc-tile> <h5>Direct Web App Reference</h5> <p>If a team elects not to create a custom font, they can also include the full <strong>hcicons2</strong> font set by referencing it from the Cashmere npm package.

Archivo.</p> <p>Picked for its versatility, Archivo is a versatile, modern sans-serif font that is functional but feels warm. It was designed to be used simultaneously in print and online platforms and supports over 200 world languages.</p> <p>Headlines can use Archivo Extra-bold or Archivo Light when the headline is large. Subheads should use Semi-bold or Medium subheadings, and the medium weight should be used on body copy. Headlines should be about twice the size of the subheading, and subheads should be about twice the size of the body copy.</p> <p>The core font family is available in seven weights, but only the weights listed on this page are approved for use within our brand: Light, Medium, SemiBold, Bold, ExtraBold.

Typically, body copy should be set in Regular, while italics and heavier weights should be applied for emphasis, quotations, links, and references.</p> <p>For best legibility, a good rule of thumb is to keep columns at roughly 60 characters per line, and leading should be set somewhere between 100-150%.</p> <p>Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface that was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly, appearance.

Implement the markup and css according to your application's set up Some logout screens are within the context of the angular application, while others live outside of it in a static HTML file. The markup provided will work for either, but if your logout case stays within the context of angular, you'll have the CSS already available via the cashmere styles, and you can use the hc-button component rather than a standard HTML button. Additionally, the messaging on the button and just above it can change according to the use case. If you would like to be more specific for a timeout case versus a manual logout you're encouraged to do so. 2. Add your logo. Replace the Cashmere logo with your own app's logo. The design team can provide this for you if you do not already have it. You can reference the file from your assets folder, inject SVG code directly, or use base64 encoding in a css background image. 3. Wire up the login button. The optimal experience is to have the \"log back in\" button take the user back where they were last within your application. This information can be passed to the logout page, or you can try looking for that information via javascript. An example: document.getElementById('hcLoginButton').addEventListener('click', function () { if (document.referrer.startsWith(document.location.origin)) { // if we landed on logout page from another page within the app (same origin), // lets navigate back where we were history.back(); } else { // otherwise, navigate to the home page window.location.href = document.location.origin; } });","link":"web/styles/logout","category":"components","displayName":"logout","type":"example","section":"how-to-implement-the-logout-screen"},{"id":"example_html_and_css","title":"Example Html And Css - Logout","content":"Example HTML and CSS #hcLogout { font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center; top: 0px; left: 0px; position: fixed; height: 100%; width: 100%; margin: 0; background-color: #2e3946; color: #fff; font-size: 14px; } #hcLogout div { margin-bottom: 15px; } #logo { width: auto; height: 30px; background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat; } #triflame { height: 50px; width: 50px; margin: 10px 0 15px; } .green-button { min-width: 215px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 35px; touch-action: manipulation; cursor: pointer; border-radius: 5px; background-color: #00a859; color: #ffffff; border: none; } .green-button:hover { background-color: #05864a; } .st0{fill:#FFFFFF;} You have been logged out.

Add the needed markup and css to your index.html file. Contrary to typical best practices, in this case it's preferable to put the raw CSS/HTML for the launch screen directly into the index.html file. This allows the styles to be immediately available, avoiding a blank page while waiting for the needed HTTP requests to complete. In Angular applications, this code can be placed within the root element tags (illustrated below), and will be replaced when the root component is ready. 2. Add your logo. Replace the SVG XML inside the #logoContainer with your own app logo. The design team can provide this for you, or if you already have the logo, you can use an online tool to convert the SVG into XML (or base64). 3. [Optional] Edit (or remove) the splash screen message. In this example, the text is \"Loading Application\". The message might change during the bootstrap process, perhaps to something like \"Authenticating\", or \"Loading the things...\". 4. Wire in launch styles elsewhere as needed. If you'd like to show the launch screen after the initial load is complete, perhaps while you wait for authentication or other Angular resolvers to complete, you can also place the launch screen markup and styles in another component. You'll no longer need to place the styles directly in the markup.","link":"web/styles/launch-screen","category":"components","displayName":"launch-screen","type":"example","section":"how-to-implement-the-launch-screen"},{"id":"example_index_html","title":"Example Index Html - Launch Screen","content":"Example index.html Cashmere Application body { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } #preBootstrap { position: fixed; top: 0px; left: 0px; height: 100%; width: 100%; background-color: #2E3946; z-index: 999999; } #triflame { position: absolute; height: 50px; width: 50px; top: calc(50% - 25px); left: calc(50% - 25px); } #logoContainer { position: absolute; top: calc(50% - 100px); left: 0; width: 100%; } #logo { width: 180px; height: 30px; } .shape { fill: #fff;} #hcSplashSpinner { width: 100px; height: 100px; transform-origin: center center; border: 3px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); border-radius: 50%; border-top: 3px solid #fff; } #bootstrapMessage { position: absolute; bottom: 45px; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%); padding: 4px 30px; letter-spacing: 5px; text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 11px; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-radius: 4px; color: #fff; } .center-children { display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; } .fade-spin { animation: spin 1.2s linear infinite, fade 1.5s; -webkit-animation: spin 1.2s linear infinite, fade 1.5s; } @keyframes spin { 0% { transform: rotate(0deg); } 100% { transform: rotate(360deg); } } @-webkit-keyframes spin { 0% { -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg); } 100% { -webkit-transform: rotate(360deg); } } .fade { animation: fade 1.5s; -webkit-animation: fade 1.5s; } @keyframes fade { 0% { opacity: 0; } 100% { opacity: 1; } } @-webkit-keyframes fade { 0% { opacity: 0; } 100% { opacity: 1; } } .st0{fill:#FFFFFF;} Loading Application","link":"web/styles/launch-screen","category":"components","displayName":"launch-screen","type":"example","section":"example-index-html"},{"id":"minimalist_version","title":"Minimalist Version - Launch Screen","content":"Minimalist Version The charcoal blue loading screen above is the default for Health Catalyst web applications.

Duplicate one of the existing tooltip worksheets from the template to ensure consistent sizing of the button. From the worksheet, click the Tooltip button in the Marks panel. There you can edit the information you'd like to appear in the tooltip. Back on the dashboard, drag the duplicated tooltip sheet to the header horizontal container.

They allow users to more deeply investigate the cause of trends or finds areas for improvement. But filters can be a double-edged sword, because they can also add significant complexity to both the UI and UX of an accelerator. As a result, care must be taken in what filters are given prominence and how they are displayed. Another important consideration with filters is ensuring that user has a clear understanding of what filters are currently active. The sidebar is always visible, so filters being used can be easily seen. Be careful about applying any filters that are not easily reset or not visible to the user.

A filter sidebar should be formatted as following: Background: slate-gray-400 #708090 Width: 250px There should be 10px of vertical space at the top of the sidebar before the first filter or metric. Counts Frequently it is useful for accelerators to a display a count of key metrics as part of the filter sidebar (e.g. Encounters, Unique Patients). This gives users a clear indication of the sample size being used to determine the values on their dashboard. For example, if they've filtered the sample size down too small, the values in the dashboard will no longer be useful. As many counts may be included as needed, one on top of the other. Filter Counts These counts should be the first item on the sidebar, and should displayed as a horizontal container with the label on the left and the value on the right.

The scale you choose comes down to a tradeoff between ease of use for the respondent (generally it’s easier to answer on a 7 point scale than an 11 point one) and robustness of results (an 11 point scale gives a larger continuum so over time you can more easily see if the needle is moving). User satisfaction is often rolled up to a “satisfaction score” for the product and tracked by the organization as a key metric for sustainability and growth.

The question under the NPS methodology is “How likely are you to recommend [insert product or service name] to a friend or colleague?” This methodology is founded upon a lot of research showing that people will go so far as to recommend a product when they are satisfied with it themselves. So it takes satisfaction one step further. It is a metric of enthusiasm and happiness with a product. Oftentimes a second free text question is used following the NPS® question. This question asks the user why they gave the rating they did, which reveals what’s making them very happy or unhappy. The NPS methodology uses a 0 to 11-point scale, where respondents scoring 0 to 6 are considered “Detractors”, 7 and 8 are considered “Passives” and 9 and 10 are considered “Promoters”. To calculate NPS, the percent of Detractors is subtracted from the percent of Promoters. This score is represented as a negative or positive number (not a percent; a common error). This score can then be used to compare a company or product to past performance or benchmarks. One caution regarding NPS is that small sample sizes can result in volatility when tracked over time which can raise red flags unnecessarily. Arguably, several hundred respondents are a necessary guidepost to be able to reliably track the NPS metric. However, on an individual level or with smaller sample sizes, it is still highly useful to understand whether an individual is a Promoter, Passive or Detractor or to track the percent who are likely to recommend the product (e.g., percent who answer 8,9 or 10). &nbsp;","link":"web/components/typeform-survey/usage","category":"components","displayName":"typeform-survey","type":"usage","section":"net-promoter-score"},{"id":"frequency_of_gathering_feedback","title":"Frequency of Gathering Feedback - Typeform Survey","content":"Frequency of Gathering Feedback There is no rule of thumb that applies to all situations in terms of how often to gather feedback.

They can be used to confirm successful actions, warn of potential issues, and inform the user of errors, among other things. Following are some guidelines and suggestions for effectively using toasts in your application. Toast Header Always use title case. Keep it short. Preferably use 2-3 words, but can use more. Don’t use contractions. For success messages, write the action first, then the object second. “Saved Job” instead of “Job Saved” Why? In most cases, the user is aware of the object they are interacting with, so the action word ought to go first. That way with the very first word they read, users are likely given all they need to know that what they expected to happen did happen. For error messages If the error is the direct result of a user action on an object, you can leave off the object name, and then just clarify the type of object in the error message. “Save Failed” instead of “Failed to Save Job”. If the error isn’t the direct result of a user-triggered action, the name of the object becomes more important to include in the header. As an example, a user navigates to a job page and the page attempts to load job type options but fails to do so. “Failed to Load Job Types”. Toast Message Use sentence case Be consistent with the use of punctuation for one-sentence messages (Either do or don’t use it throughout your application). Always use punctuation if there’s more than one sentence. Include extra detail that may be helpful to describe what happened If multiple things were impacted Consider including the count of objects affected in numerical form: ”Successfully updated 6 jobs” Use proper pluralization instead of hardcoding: ”job” or “jobs” instead of “job(s)” If one (or just a few) things were impacted, include the name of the thing: “Successfully updated ‘My Awesome Job’” For errors Don’t include technical details that aren’t appropriate or helpful for the audience: \"Unable to connect. Port 5001 seems to be blocked” Concisely explain the implications: \"Unable to add Job 7 to the queue. Jobs 8 and on will not be run.\" Offer remediation steps if available: \"Double check your job settings\" or \"Contact your admin if the problem continues\" More writing tips: Check out our UX writing guide Do I always need a header AND message for my toast? Nope. You can use just the header or just the message. For cases where there’s one 1-3 words you want to give, just a header would be appropriate. If there are just 4-7 words, a message alone would be appropriate. If you’re not providing any additional information or clarification, DON’T use both. A bad example- Header: “Saved Job” Message: “The job was saved.” If you’re providing more than 5-7 words, you should consider using both header and message so that the user can have a quickly scannable header to help them decide if they want to read on. Colors, Ornaments, & Actions Green for success Red for error Orange for warning Blue or white for informational You can consider adding buttons or links if there's somewhere to navigate, a modal to open, or actions to take. If adding clickable elements to your toast, use a white custom toast You can consider adding a more specific icon as appropriate For long-running, non-blocking actions, consider using a toast with a progress bar.","link":"web/components/toaster/usage","category":"components","displayName":"toaster","type":"usage","section":"using-toast-messages"},{"id":"tile_overview","title":"Tile Overview - Tile","content":"Tile Overview Tiles are a common UI element that you can use to segment content on your page.

It's blue and uppercase, so it stands more as a design element and tends to get out of the way of the primary content on the tile. title - this is an all purpose header that will inherit the color of its parent. It can be used in a number of situations from sidebars to lists. center - this header type is often used on dashboards or menus where the tiles are small and contain a specific piece of information. As in the example, it is often used with an icon above the header text, and a description line below. Uses include: a headline metric, a link to specific page, or settings for a particular type of content.","link":"web/components/tile/usage","category":"components","displayName":"tile","type":"usage","section":"tile-headers"},{"id":"overview","title":"Overview - Table","content":"Overview The hc-table provides a Cashmere styled data-table that can be used to display rows of data. This table builds on the foundation of the CDK data-table and uses a similar interface for its data input and template, except that its element and attribute selectors will be prefixed with hc- instead of cdk-. For more information on the interface and a detailed look at how the table is implemented, see the guide covering the CDK data-table. Getting Started 1. Write your hc-table and provide data Begin by adding the `` component to your template and passing in data. The simplest way to provide data to the table is by passing a data array to the table's dataSource input. The table will take the array and render a row for each object in the data array. ... Since the table optimizes for performance, it will not automatically check for changes to the data array. Instead, when objects are added, removed, or moved on the data array, you can trigger an update to the table's rendered rows by calling its renderRows() method. While an array is the simplest way to bind data into the data source, it is also the most limited. For more complex applications, using a DataSource instance is recommended. See the section \"Advanced data sources\" below for more information. 2. Define the column templates Next, write your table's column templates. Each column definition should be given a unique name and contain the content for its header and row cells. Here's a simple column definition with the name 'userName'. The header cell contains the text \"Name\" and each row cell will render the name property of each row's data. Name {{user.name}} 3. Define the row templates Finally, once you have defined your columns, you need to tell the table which columns will be rendered in the header and data rows. To start, create a variable in your component that contains the list of the columns you want to render. columnsToDisplay = ['userName', 'age']; Then add hc-header-row and hc-row to the content of your hc-table and provide your column list as inputs. Note that this list of columns provided to the rows can be in any order, not necessary the order in which you wrote the column definitions. Also, you do not necessarily have to include every column that was defined in your template. This means that by changing your column list provided to the rows, you can easily re-order and include/exclude columns dynamically.","link":"web/components/table/usage","category":"components","displayName":"table","type":"usage","section":"overview"},{"id":"advanced_data_sources","title":"Advanced data sources - Table","content":"Advanced data sources The simplest way to provide data to your table is by passing a data array.

The DataSource is meant to serve a place to encapsulate any sorting, filtering, and data retrieval logic specific to the application. A DataSource is simply a base class that has two functions: connect and disconnect. The connect function will be called by the table to receive a stream that emits the data array that should be rendered. The table will call disconnect when the table is destroyed, which may be the right time to clean up any subscriptions that may have been registered during the connect process.","link":"web/components/table/usage","category":"components","displayName":"table","type":"usage","section":"data-source"},{"id":"features","title":"Features - Table","content":"Features The HcTable is focused on a single responsibility: efficiently render rows of data in a performant and accessible way. You'll notice that the table itself doesn't come out of the box with a lot of features, but expects that the table will be included in a composition of components that fills out its features. For example, you can add sorting to the table by using HcSort and mutating the data provided to the table according to their outputs. The text alignment of a column may be set using the justify property on the ng-container of a column. It defaults to a value of left, but my be set to right or center. Columns containing numerical data should typically be right aligned. To simplify the use case of having a table that can sort, and filter an array of data, the Cashmere library comes with a HcTableDataSource that has already implemented the logic of determining what rows should be rendered according to the current table state. To add these feature to the table, check out their respective sections below.","link":"web/components/table/usage","category":"components","displayName":"table","type":"usage","section":"features"},{"id":"sorting","title":"Sorting - Table","content":"Sorting To add sorting behavior to the table, add the hcSort directive to the table and add hc-sort-header to each column header cell that should trigger sorting. Name {{element.position}} If you are using the HcTableDataSource for your table's data source, provide the HcSort directive to the data source and it will automatically listen for sorting changes and change the order of data rendered by the table. The default sort order of values is case insensitive as follows: \"[Null]123ABC\". By default, the HcTableDataSource sorts with the assumption that the sorted column's name matches the data property name that the column displays. For example, the following column definition is named position, which matches the name of the property displayed in the row cell. Note that if the data properties do not match the column names, or if a more complex data property accessor is required, then a custom sortingDataAccessor function can be set to override the default data accessor on the HcTableDataSource. If you are not using the HcTableDataSource, but instead implementing custom logic to sort your data, listen to the sort's (hcSortChange) event and re-order your data according to the sort state. If you are providing a data array directly to the table, don't forget to call renderRows() on the table, since it will not automatically check the array for changes. The position of the sorting indicator can be set using the arrowPosition property. If set to before it will place the indicator to the left of the header text. The HcSort is one provided solution to sorting your table's data, but it is not the only option.","link":"web/components/table/usage","category":"components","displayName":"table","type":"usage","section":"sorting"},{"id":"column_resizing","title":"Column Resizing - Table","content":"Column Resizing To add column resizing to a table, add hc-cell-resizer to the cells where you could like the functionality included.

Those that contain it will change the cursor to the column resize state when the borders are hovered over, and can be dragged to resize. {{columnObjects[1].title}} {{element.position}} The example above will allow the user to resize the column from either the header or body cells. The resizer adds the drag targets, handles the dragging functionality, and stores a width value - but it leaves the actually resizing of the cell to the app. So in the example above, note the addition of [style.width] to the cell tag, which is bound to an array of column widths the app stores. The resizer will emit a CellResizeEvent via the resized property. This will contain the new width and whether the cell was scaled left or right. This is useful in determining how to scale neighboring cells to match. If minimum and maximum widths are needed for cells, the app is responsible to enforce them when setting cell widths. A resizing event is also available that will set a boolean value to true while the cell is being dragged. The dragging values that are returned are based on pixels moved. For pixel perfect dragging, make sure and add table-layout: fixed to your table css. This will allow the table to overflow its container. Otherwise, the table will scale its cells proportionally to the container width - so the column dragging may be faster or slower than your mouse depending on how much the table has been scaled.","link":"web/components/table/usage","category":"components","displayName":"table","type":"usage","section":"column-resizing"},{"id":"filtering","title":"Filtering - Table","content":"Filtering Cashmere does not provide a specific component to be used for filtering the HcTable since there is no single common approach to adding a filter UI to table data. A general strategy is to add an input where users can type in a filter string and listen to this input to change what data is offered from the data source to the table. If you are using the HcTableDataSource, simply provide the filter string to the HcTableDataSource. The data source will reduce each row data to a serialized form and will filter out the row if it does not contain the filter string. By default, the row data reducing function will concatenate all the object values and convert them to lowercase. For example, the data object {id: 123, name: 'Mr. Smith', favoriteColor: 'blue'} will be reduced to 123mr. smithblue. If your filter string was blue then it would be considered a match because it is contained in the reduced string, and the row would be displayed in the table. To override the default filtering behavior, a custom filterPredicate function can be set which takes a data object and filter string and returns true if the data object is considered a match.","link":"web/components/table/usage","category":"components","displayName":"table","type":"usage","section":"filtering"},{"id":"pagination","title":"Pagination - Table","content":"Pagination There are cashmere pagination components available for usage.

Similarly, this can also be applied to the table's footer row. Note that if you are using the native ` and using Safari, then the footer will only stick if sticky` is applied to all the rendered footer rows. It is also possible to fix cell columns to the start or end of the horizontally scrolling viewport. To do this, add the sticky or stickyEnd directive to the ng-container column definition. This feature is supported by Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is not supported in IE, but it does fail gracefully so that the rows simply do not stick. Note that on Safari mobile when using the flex-based table, a cell stuck in more than one direction will struggle to stay in the correct position as you scroll. For example, if a header row is stuck to the top and the first column is stuck, then the top-left-most cell will appear jittery as you scroll. Also, sticky positioning in Edge will appear shaky for special cases. For example, if the scrolling container has a complex box shadow and has sibling elements, the stuck cells will appear jittery.

For example, if you want the measurables to stack in a horizontal direction, then the container needs to have a width. If the width is auto, then the container will either grow with new elements added, or it will put everything into the more menu. Also add a template reference variable to the container so you can get a reference to it in the component. Add an hc-measurable, with an ngFor directive applied to show your list of items. Make sure to include a trackBy function, since the sizes are cached inside the hc-measurables. Without a trackBy, the hc-measurables will be recreated each time the ngFor runs, causing the MeasurableComponents to recalculate the size. Also make sure to provide a unique string as an input to the hc-measurable (bound into the itemKey input). Add the component to fill the container inside of the hc-measurable. Optionally add a more button that opens up a menu. After this step, your template should look something like this: More {{moreItem.displayText}} You will need a ViewChild property referencing the container (to get the size) and a ViewChildren property referencing the MeasurableComponents to be able to send those to the service call. If you include a Add properties similar to the following to the component containing the hc-measurables. @ViewChild('measurableContainer') measurableContainer: ElementRef; @ViewChildren(MeasurableComponent) measurables: QueryList; // Include this if you have the More button @ViewChild('moreItems') moreTrigger: HcPopoverAnchorDirective; Inject a MeasurableService and a ChangeDetectorRef in the constructor of the component: constructor( private measurableService: MeasurableService, private ref: ChangeDetectorRef ) {} Create a method that will recalculate whether the components are shown in the container or in the more menu. This can be called whenever there are updates that need to be taken into account. You should apply a @HostListener(window:resize) annotation to this method so it is called whenever the window is resized. The method can look like this: @HostListener('window:resize') refreshItems(): void { // Close the popover more menu if it is currently open. if (this.moreTrigger) { this.moreTrigger.closePopover(); } // If there are no items, then nothing can be done. if (!this.items) { return; } // Show and hide the measurable components as needed, then // return the keys of components that were hidden. const moreKeys = this.measurableService.fillContainer( // Pass in an array of type MeasurableComponent[]. this.measurables.toArray(), // Get the available size through either the clientWidth // or clientHeight from the measurable container. this.measurableContainer.nativeElement.clientWidth, // Send in how much space in pixels should be allotted for // the More button in case it needs to be shown. 116, // Optional. Defaults to 'horizontal', but can be 'vertical'. 'horizontal', // Optional. Defaults to a function that does nothing. This // is an action called for each MeasurableComponent // that fits in the container. (mc: MeasurableComponent) => { console.log(mc); }, // Optional. Defaults to a function that does nothing. This // is an action called for each MeasurableComponent // that does not fit in the container. (mc: MeasurableComponent) => { console.log(mc); } ); // Set the items that should show up in the more menu. this.moreItems = this.items.filter(item => moreKeys.has(item.key)); // Run a change detection cycle to display the changes in the UI. this.ref.detectChanges(); } Call the refresh method whenever something changes that may require a recalculation. If the component is always displayed in the app (for example, in the case of the navbar), then a @HostListener('window.load') annotation on a method is a good place to run setup logic. If the component is only displayed at certain routes (for example, in the case of the Instance Switcher), the window.load event may not fire when the component shows up on the screen. In this case, it is better to add the logic shown in the \"Initializing Measurables on Component Load\" to the ngAfterViewInit method. Other places that can be of use is in the ngOnChanges (especially if all inputs need to trigger a refresh), or in setters on some of the inputs.","link":"web/components/measurable/usage","category":"components","displayName":"measurable","type":"usage","section":"setting-up-a-component-to-use-measurable"},{"id":"adding_spacing_between_measurables","title":"Adding spacing between measurables - Measurable","content":"Adding spacing between measurables If you need to add some spacing between elements in the container, it is best to add a margin or padding to the element inside of the hc-measurable.

All of the component lifecycle hooks run before the component is actually rendered to the screen, so the expression in the above example this.measurableContainer.nativeElement.clientWidth would return zero in all of the lifecycle hooks. If the component is on every page of the app (for example, a navbar), then adding a Host Listener like the following should be enough: @HostListener('window:load') _setupInstances(): void { this.refreshItems(); this.measurables.changes.pipe( takeUntil(this.unsubscribe$) ).subscribe(() => this.refreshItems()); } Note that any Cashmere components do not fall into this category, since the documentation pages are not on the screen for the full time. Any components that are not on the screen need to have the refresh method called after the component is rendered. There are not currently any lifecycle hooks that run after the page is rendered, so the approach taken in the Instance Switcher component is the following: ngAfterViewInit(): void { this.checkContainerSize(); } private checkContainerSize() { if (this.instancesContainer.nativeElement.clientWidth === 0 && this.animationFrameCount++ this.checkContainerSize()); } else { this.refreshInstances(); this._instanceChips.changes.pipe( takeUntil(this._unsubscribe$) ).subscribe(() => this.refreshInstances()); } } This will check on a few animation frames until the width is a positive number, and then it will run the refresh and subscribe to changes in the view. If it gets to a certain threshold, then it will also exit the loop by running the refresh and subscribing to changes in the view.

For example, the NativeDateAdapter allows ISO 8601 strings to be passed to the datepicker and automatically converted to the proper object type.

The validator will check to see if the value entered is a valid date. Beyond that, there are three properties that add additional date validation to the datepicker input. The first two are the min and max properties. In addition to enforcing validation on the input, these properties will disable all dates on the calendar popup before or after the respective values and prevent the user from advancing the calendar past the month or year (depending on current view) containing the min or max date. The second way to add date validation is using the hcDatepickerFilter property of the datepicker input. This property accepts a function of => boolean (where `` is the date type used by the datepicker, see Choosing a date implementation. A result of true indicates that the date is valid and a result of false indicates that it is not. Again this will also disable the dates on the calendar that are invalid. However, one important difference between using hcDatepickerFilter vs using min or max is that filtering out all dates before or after a certain point, will not prevent the user from advancing the calendar past that point. In this example the user can back past 2005, but all of the dates before then will be unselectable. They will not be able to go further back in the calendar than 2000. If they manually type in a date that is before the min, after the max, or filtered out, the input will have validation errors. Each validation property has a different error that can be checked: A value that violates the min property will have a hcDatepickerMin error. A value that violates the max property will have a hcDatepickerMax error. A value that violates the hcDatepickerFilter property will have a hcDatepickerFilter error. The input's native (input) and (change) events will only trigger due to user interaction with the input element; they will not fire when the user selects a date from the calendar popup. Therefore, the datepicker input also has support for (dateInput) and (dateChange) events. These trigger when the user interacts with either the input or the popup. The (dateInput) event will fire whenever the value changes due to the user typing or selecting a date from the calendar.

This means that it can be made to work with a variety of different date implementations. However it also means that developers need to make sure to provide the appropriate pieces for the datepicker to work with their chosen implementation. The easiest way to ensure this is just to import one of the pre-made modules: | Module | Date type | Supported locales | Dependencies | Import from | | -------------------- | --------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | | HcNativeDateModule | Date | en-US | None | @healthcatalyst/cashmere | These modules include providers for DateAdapter and HCDATEFORMATS @NgModule({ imports: [DatepickerModule, HcNativeDateModule] }) export class MyApp {} Because DateAdapter is a generic class, HcDatepicker and HcDatepickerInput also need to be made generic. When working with these classes (for example as a ViewChild) you should include the appropriate generic type that corresponds to the DateAdapter implementation you are using. For example: @Component({...}) export class MyComponent { @ViewChild(HcDatepicker) datepicker: HcDatepicker; } _Please note: HcNativeDateModule is based off of the functionality available in JavaScript's native Date object, and is thus not suitable for many locales. One of the biggest shortcomings of the native Date object is the inability to set the parse format. SugarJS is a JavaScript library used by many Health Catalyst applications to handle parsing user input into Date objects. It handles a wide variety of input formats and supports multiple languages. To use SugarJS with the Cashmere DatePicker, you need to declare a Sugar Date Adapter as demonstrated in the example below. See the Datepicker Sugar example on the examples tab for more information. export class SugarDateAdapter extends NativeDateAdapter { parse(value: any): Date | null { return createDate(value); } } It is also possible to create your own DateAdapter that works with any date format your app requires. This is accomplished by subclassing DateAdapter and providing your subclass as the DateAdapter implementation. You will also want to make sure that the HCDATEFORMATS provided in your app are formats that can be understood by your date implementation. See Customizing the parse and display formats for more information about HCDATEFORMATS. @NgModule({ imports: [DatepickerModule], providers: [ {provide: DateAdapter, useClass: MyDateAdapter}, {provide: HCDATEFORMATS, useValue: MYDATEFORMATS} ] }) export class MyApp {}","link":"web/components/datepicker/usage","category":"components","displayName":"datepicker","type":"usage","section":"choosing-a-date-implementation-and-date-format-settings"},{"id":"customizing_the_parse_and_display_formats","title":"Customizing the parse and display formats - Datepicker","content":"Customizing the parse and display formats The HCDATEFORMATS object is just a collection of formats that the datepicker uses when parsing and displaying dates.

It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p> <p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p> <p>&#151;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln\" target=\"_blank\">Abraham Lincoln</a></p>`;
