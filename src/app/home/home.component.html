                    The <a routerLink="/foundations">foundations</a> of the Cashmere Design System are universal brand guidelines that all our digital content should follow.
                    But Cashmere isn’t only a design system, it’s also an open-source <a routerLink="/web/components">Angular component library</a>.
                    Everything under the <strong>Web Apps</strong> tab is meant for you.
                    Take a look at our <a routerLink="/web/guides">developer guides</a> to get started incorporating Cashmere into your project.
                    Although Angular is our preferred framework, you can <a href="/web/guides/using-customizing-components">leverage Cashmere’s stylesheets</a> in any web app - even the most basic HTML site.
                    <br><br>
                    And get involved! All developers are welcome to contribute code or improvement ideas to the library via our <a href="https://github.com/HealthCatalyst/Fabric.Cashmere">GitHub project</a>.

                    Health Catalyst analytics accelerators are tailored, customizable tools built on business intelligence platforms like Qlik, Tableau, and PowerBI.
                    These accelerators require the same UI/UX considerations as web applications and should carry all the same hallmarks of the Health Catalyst brand.
                    However, each platform has its own unique design considerations and implementations of the Cashmere foundations.
                    <br><br>
                    Head to the <strong><a routerLink="/analytics">Analytics</a></strong> tab&mdash;and look for the section specific to platform you’re developing in.
                    To begin, download the most current version of the template for the platform you're using.
                    Then refer to the additional guidelines for that platform for additional information around type, color, layout, etc.

                    All Health Catalyst media should follow <a routerLink="/foundations">Cashmere Foundations</a>&mdash;this includes elements like color, type, and iconography.
                    Additionally, you’ll find a collection of styles and standards specific to content creation in the <strong><a routerLink="/content">Content</a></strong> tab.
