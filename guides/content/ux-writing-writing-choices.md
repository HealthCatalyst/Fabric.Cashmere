# Writing Choices 
<br>
<br>

:::

##### Use active voice

Passive voice is overly wordy and confusing.

-   **Don't:** The **Search** button *should be clicked* when you are ready to search for an item.

-   **Do:** Click **Search** to find an article.

:::

:::

##### Capitalize correctly and consistently 

Use capitalization consistently:

-   Use title case for titles and headlines (e.g., The Lord of the Rings).

-   Use sentence case for buttons, form labels, and links (e.g., Learn more about the guidelines on the CDC website).

-   Never use all caps (capitalizing all letters).

See [5 Rules for Choosing the Right Words on Button Labels (uxmovement.com)](https://uxmovement.com/buttons/5-rules-for-choosing-the-right-words-on-button-labels/) for more information. An example from the article is included below.

##### Use consistent terminology 

Inconsistent terminology creates confusion and makes it harder to scan text.

If you decide to call the process of arranging something "Scheduling" in one part of UI, do not call it a "Booking" in another part of your UI. See the [Usage Guidelines on Cashmere](https://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/content/usage) for preferred usage of some terms and abbreviations.

:::

:::

##### Address the user as "you"

Don't refer to the user in both the second person and the first person within the same UI. Health Catalyst prefers second person ("you") when addressing the user.

**Don't:** Change the user's preferences in **Account.**

**Do:** Change your preferences in **Account**.

:::

:::

##### Align with the user's platform

Use language that's consistent with the user's platform. For example, the terms for describing interaction with a desktop app do not necessarily apply to mobile platforms.

**Don't:** Use **click** when referring to an action in a mobile app.

**Do:** Use **tap** when referring to an action in a mobile app.

:::

:::

##### Don't use double negatives

Double negatives increase cognitive load. They make users spend extra time decoding the message.

**Don't:** I do *not* want to *un*subscribe.

**Do:** Keep me subscribed.

:::

:::

##### Avoid using jargon

For clarity, remove the technical terms and use familiar, understandable words and phrases. It's especially important to avoid jargon in error messages.

**Don't:** System error (code #2234): An authentication error has occurred.

**Do:** Sign-in error: You entered an incorrect password.

:::

:::

##### Use parallel construction in a list or series

In a list or series, start each item with the same part of speech. For example, in this list, each item starts with a present-tense verb.

**Example:** To start a car:

-   Put your seatbelt on.

-   Turn the key.

-   Put the car in gear.

-   Press the gas pedal with your foot.

:::

:::

##### Make text scannable

Users scan UX text. Help them scan by writing the text it in short, scannable blocks. Chunk text into shorter sentences and paragraphs. Keep the most important text up front and then ruthlessly edit what comes after it.

Also, too much information can quickly overwhelm users. Reveal detail as needed. Use a mechanism of progressive disclosure to show more details (e.g., a link or popup).

:::

:::

##### Use present tense

Avoid using future or past tense verbs to describe an action.

**Don't:** The video will download. The video downloaded.

**Do:** The video downloads.

:::

:::

##### Use specific rather than generic verbs

Specific verbs are more meaningful to users than generic ones.

**Do:** Connect, Save, etc.
