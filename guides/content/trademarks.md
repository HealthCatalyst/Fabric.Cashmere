##### Usage Guidelines

If any trademark (®/™) used above appears multiple times on a page or in a document, either using the “®/™” with the first mention of the mark or with the most prominent use of the mark is sufficient. The logo, if it appears, does not count as the first use.

&nbsp;

Do not use trademarked terms as nouns—only use as an adjective. For example:

-   **Yes:** The HAS® conference… or The CORUS™ Suite
-   **No:** HAS® is an awesome conference. CORUS™ is more than some outdated cost system.

&nbsp;

Further, use the mark as a proper adjective modifying a noun that identifies the kind of product offered. Use the trademark together with the generic name of the product/service.

-   **Yes:** Health systems that value a next-generation costing system rely on the CORUS™ software.
-   **No:** Health systems that value a next-generation costing system rely on CORUS™.

&nbsp;

Never alter a trademark. Do not make it possessive. Do not add prefixes, hyphens, or otherwise modify.

-   **Yes:** The reliability of Health Catalyst® services means that health systems can count on…
-   **No:** Health Catalyst’s service and reliability means that health systems can count on…

&nbsp;

For the registered marks, use the ® (R in the circle) superscript symbol on the mark, which indicates that it is federally registered.

For the unregistered marks, use the TM superscript symbol, which helps to establish rights in the marks and can be used whether or not they are registered (no approval needed).

Use the superscript symbols on logos, whenever they appear.
