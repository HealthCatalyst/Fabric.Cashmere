##### Form Field Text Formatting

For both the labels and contents of form fields, please use the following formatting:

Capitalize first word only, except in cases where the selection is an actual program name or proper name (e.g. Patient non-adherence or challenges in care management; Duplicate patient; Algorithm incorrect; Comprehensive HIV AIDS Management Program (CHAMP), Grace Program, LSU Diabetes, Salt Lake City, etc.).

&nbsp;

##### Form Field Labels

Use a colon at the end of form field labels (e.g. Email address:). A colon implies a direct connection between the label text and a particular control or set of controls. The only situation where a colon should not be used is when the label and control work together to form a single sentence.
