## Goals

-   Balance their team's workload (distribution of the patient panels / types of patients / conditions / complexity / resources)
-   Finding efficiencies to speed up their workflow (pressure from above and below / stretched very thin)
-   Report to [Care Management Director](/content/personas/care-management-director) on findings related to program effectiveness
    -   Patient count, enrollment percentages, time to enrollment (all metrics exposed in Care Administration)
-   Avoid redundancy, duplication of staff assignments
-   Curate the patient list for care management
-   Maintain the content for patient applications
-   Manage / communicate with their staff of care coordinators
-   Improve quality of patient care (improve outcomes)
-   Decrease patient costs (optimize utilization)

## Needs

-   Reassign patients if a care team lead leaves the organization.
-   Conveniently shift work between team members to accommodate unexpected and expected staff absences.
-   Review pending patients following the approval process defined by my organization.
-   Easily assign new or approved patients to care managers daily.
-   Combine multiple patient lists into a single actionable queue
-   Visibility into staff performance metrics
-   Manually add patient referrals to the master patient list from various sources outside of the EDW (email from doctor, phone call, etc)
-   Conveniently audit the patient list to find those who care management needs have not been addressed
-   Select from current data and export for external tools
-   Easily trigger a refresh if application data from EDW is not current
