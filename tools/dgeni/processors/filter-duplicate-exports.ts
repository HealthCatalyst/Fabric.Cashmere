 *
 * ```ts
 *   // Some file in @angular/cdk/scrolling
 *   export {ScrollDispatcher} from './scroll-dispatcher';
 *
 *   // Other file in @angular/cdk/overlay
 *   export {ScrollDispatcher} from '@angular/cdk/scrolling';

 *   export {ScrollDispatcher as X} from './scroll-dispatcher';
 * ```
 *
 * This issue occurs sometimes in the Angular Material repository, because some imports are
 * re-exported with a different name (for deprecation), or from a different secondary entry-point.
