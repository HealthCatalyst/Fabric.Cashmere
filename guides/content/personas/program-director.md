# Robert Coleman

### Program Manager or Director/Domain Coordinator/Regulatory Compliance Director

*"I need to identify priorities to drive clinical improvement, but I don’t trust the data, and it’s too hard to dig up what I need—even with the help of an analyst."*

<br>

Robert is accountable for performance and outcomes improvement in his domain area. He is data savvy, especially with Excel; previously used to lots of manual data aggregation and delayed data (several months behind); frustrated with his ability to identify priorities or make interventions or due to data lag or lack of context; and spends the bulk of his time on data curation rather than interventions.

## Goals

-   Improve performance (process & outcomes) in his domain area in the most meaningful way for the organization (i.e., improvements that yield the most vital benefits)
-   Help physicians understand the importance of documentation in the EHR and the impact on quality
-   Take action/follow-up on cases where an identified process is not followed or an adverse outcome or trend is reported
-   Initiate educational intervention in departments/facilities where adverse events, trends, or comparative performance are reported
-   Prevent disease/condition, safety risks, or inappropriate utilization through interventions on a broader level (process redesign/triage processes/EMR alerts)
-   Report to executive leadership on the state of improvement efforts such as harm prevention, utilization management, or quality improvement (high-level reports); make the case for the importance of improvement in this area
-   Report to the physician advisory group on improvement efforts such as harm prevention, utilization management, or quality improvement (detailed reports); make the case for the importance of improvement in this area
-   Participate in multidisciplinary partnership/workgroup across the institution to address improvement efforts in a targeted area

## Needs

-   Quickly identify care gaps, over- or under-utilization, areas of under-performance, etc., and be able to infer priorities for improvement work
-   Get input on what needs to be measured to meet goals
-   Drill into specific cases to find enough details to investigate—or link to where to find that information
-   Measure impact of specific interventions over time (exactly what the hospital system is undertaking)
-   Benefit from automated measurement—more timely data that takes less time to collect, data with more context
-   Use multiple methods to export data for effective communication (Excel, visualizations)
-   Share targeted feedback with frontline providers or nurses who may not be checking the app regularly (via EMR, email, or another mechanism)—including sharing information only applicable to a specific provider (not all providers)
