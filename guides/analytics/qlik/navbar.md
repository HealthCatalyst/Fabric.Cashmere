##### Overview

![Navbar Example](./assets/analytics/qlik/qlik-navbar.png "Navbar Example")

The navbar is one of the most distinguishing elements of a Cashmere application.
It is a hallmark of the Health Catalyst app brand on all platforms.
For this reason, the styling of the navbar should not be altered from the template.

The Navbar is a **charcoal-blue** `#384655 RGB(56,70,85)` horizontal text object with a fixed `50px` height, set at `x:0, y:0`.

##### Brand

Brand is a `50px x 50px` fixed width image of the [Health Catalyst tri-flame](/foundations/logo) with a background color set to **blue** `#00aeff RGB(0,174,255)` and positioned at `x:0, y:0`.

##### App Name

App Name is the second fixed width horizontal text object in the navbar, also containing one PNG image.
The image is the name of your application in the Flexo font (so the font isn't needed).
To obtain a PNG for your application, contact the UX team via the `#design` Slack channel.

Edit the `AppName.png` image object and swap the image file with the one for your application.

The App Name should be positioned to the right of the tri-flame logo at about `x:65` and centered vertically within the Navbar. Set the **image stretch** to `Keep Aspect` and adjust the **text margin** to `2pt`.

**Important:** you will need to adjust the width of your app name image.
You want the width to be just wide enough to contain the image without shrinking it.
Begin by making the image very wide (e.g. 300).
Then continue to edit the width and reduce the size of the container until it's almost touching the right side of the image, but the image is not being scaled.

##### Links

Links is a flexible series of horizontal text objects that contain page navigation actions to the different sections of your application.
Each text object is about 100px wide and 35px tall. Adjust the text objects so that their vertical sides touch and check that any text is centered horizontally.

The background color and border on the button should be set to `None`.

The button for the currently selected page should have its font set to `Arial Bold 11pt` and color set to **offblack**. 

Additionally, there is a floating line item called `Selected Highlight` that should be positioned under the selected item.
The y position of that item should always be set to the bottom of the selected item, but the x position should match the x position of the selected item.
The width of the selected highlight item should also match the selected text object item.

All other text objects within the links section should have their font set to `Arial 10 pt`.

##### Menu Icons

Menu Icons is fixed width horizontal text object that typically only contains the question-mark icon linking to the [About Page](/analytics/qlik-about).
There is about 15px of padding before the co-branding space.

Additional menu icon links may be added to the left of the question-mark icon - for example, links to a search page, app switcher, etc.
One commonly used icon is for an Advanced Filters page (see the [Filters Section](/analytics/qlik-filters) for more information).
Guidelines for icon selection can be found in [Cashmere Foundations](/foundations/icons).

Contact the UX team via the `#design` Slack channel for icon images if they aren't in the ASO repository.

##### Co-branding

Co-Branding is the final fixed width horizontal container set to 200px wide with a **white** `#ffffff RGB(255,255,255)` background.
This space allows applications to include the logo of your customer.
Ideally you'll want the horizontal version of a customer's logo with a white or transparent background.
To configure this section, you should only have to Edit the Image and swap the file.
It should automatically resize to fit best within the container.

Note that this is an optional section.
If your application does not require co-branding, right-click on the Co-Branding container and "Remove" from the dashboard.
