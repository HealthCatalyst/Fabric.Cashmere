## Goals

-   Do first-level troubleshooting when failure notifications are sent
-   Address failures in the context of which tables are most important, which applications need to be up in what timeframe, what tables are dependent on others
-   Look into error reports (or escalate issues to [EDW Manager](/content/personas/edw-manager) when I don't understand them)
-   Investigate performance issues
-   Reload failed tables


---

## Needs

-   Use EDW Console to manage production of the EDW every morning
-   Identify the ID of failed batches
-   Identify whether a problem involves one table or many
