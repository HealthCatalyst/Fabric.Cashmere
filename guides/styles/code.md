##### Code Font
Source code should always be displayed using a monospace font. This is the font family used by this Cashmere site: `font-family: Consolas, Menlo, "Ubuntu Mono", monospace;`.

##### Code Blocks
For blocks of code larger than than three lines, it is recommended that line numbers be included.  The line numbers should be the same font size as the code, but in a light gray color so they aren't distracting.

``` html
    <hc-list>
        <hc-list-item>
            <hc-icon fontSet="fa" fontIcon="fa-snowflake-o" hcListIcon></hc-icon>
            <h4 hcListLine>SnowFlake</h4>
            <span hcListLine>Second Line</span>
        </hc-list-item>
    </hc-list>
```

##### Syntax Highlighting
Syntax highlighting can be useful to make blocks of code more readable.  The highlight.js library is our recommended highligher, using the **"GitHub Gist"** theme.  Visit [https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/) for more details.
