##### Usage Guidelines

If any trademark (®/™) used above appears multiple times on a page or in a document, either using the “®/™” with the first mention of the mark or with the most prominent use of the mark is sufficient. The logo, if it appears, does not count as the first use.

&nbsp;

Do not use trademarked terms as nouns—only use as an adjective. For example:

-   **Yes:** The HAS™ conference… or The CORUS™ Suite
-   **No:** HAS™ is an awesome conference. CORUS™ is more than some outdated cost system.

&nbsp;

Further, use the mark as a proper adjective modifying a noun that identifies the kind of product offered. Use the trademark together with the generic name of the product/service.

-   **Yes:** Health systems that value a next-generation costing system rely on the CORUS™ software.
-   **No:** Health systems that value a next-generation costing system rely on CORUS™.

&nbsp;

Never alter a trademark. Do not make it possessive. Do not add prefixes, hyphens, or otherwise modify.

-   **Yes:** The reliability of Health Catalyst® services means that health systems can count on…
-   **No:** Health Catalyst’s service and reliability means that health systems can count on…
