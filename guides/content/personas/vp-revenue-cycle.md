</div>

</div>

---

## Role

-   Weekly Report user
-   Technical Level â€“ Medium

---

## Responsibilities

-   Interested in ROI and resource utilization
-   Needs succinct & precise dashboards and complete high-level reports
-   Prefers high-level reports automated so that he does not need to log into the system

---

## Pain Points

-   If I am unable to get fast results without having to ask or wait, I won't find the product useful to me personally.
-   If I am unable to identify a secure ROI within the product, I won't be able to justify to the board and C-Suite the purchase of the product and will seek alternative options for my solution.
-   If I am unable to easily view analytical dashboards and reports I won't use them thus I won't find value in the product personally.
-   If I can't understand where the company could be losing money then I won't be able to understand where exactly our financial gaps are located.
-   If I am unable to increase productivity (do more with less FTE's) then our costs go up and become a strain on our entire organization.
-   If I am unable to increase revenue the hospital will face financial strains that impact its entire operations and existence.
