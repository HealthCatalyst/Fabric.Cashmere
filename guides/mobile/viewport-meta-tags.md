##### User Context

*Normally, I view my web app on my desktop computer, but I occasionally must send a report to a colleague when I’m using my iPhone. The web app is hard to see and use—and it looks really zoomed out. I wish it was easier to read.*

##### Explanation

You’ve probably visited a website that initially looks ‘zoomed out’ on your smartphone, and certainly seen websites that are immediately legible on your smartphone, too. Viewport meta tags are responsible for determining whether the content of the webpage appears to be too small or legible on load.

##### How to Use

Add the following <meta> tag to the <head> element on each layout template page:

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
