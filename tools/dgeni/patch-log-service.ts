 * warn:    Unresolved TypeScript symbol(s): _MatToolbarMixinBase - doc "lib/toolbar/MatToolbar"
 *    (class)  - from file "lib/toolbar/toolbar.ts" - starting at line 37, ending at line 98
 * ```
 *
 * Those warnings are valid, but are not fixable because the base class is created dynamically
 * through mixin functions and will be stored as a constant.
