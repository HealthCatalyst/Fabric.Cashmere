##### Found a Bug?

Before you [submit an issue](https://github.com/HealthCatalyst/Fabric.Cashmere/issues), search the archive. Maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us maximize the effort we spend fixing issues and adding new features by not reporting duplicate issues. Providing the following information increases the chances your issue is dealt with quickly:

*   **Overview of the issue**. If an error is being thrown, a non-minified stack trace helps.
*   **Angular and Cashmere version**. Note which versions are affected.
*   **Motivation or use case**. Explain what you are trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you.
*   **Browsers and operating systems**. Answer "Is this a problem with all browsers?"
*   **Reproduce the error**. Provide a live example (using CodePen, JsBin, Plunker, etc.) or a unambiguous set of steps.
*   **Screenshots**. Due to the visual nature of Cashmere, screenshots help the team triage issues far more quickly than a text description.
*   **Related issues**. Answer "Has a similar issue been reported before?"
*   **Suggest a fix**. If you can't fix the bug yourself, point to what might be causing the problem (e.g., a line of code or commit).

Even better, submit a pull request with a fix!

##### Want a Feature?

Request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HealthCatalyst/Fabric.Cashmere/issues). If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first to be sure we can use it. Please consider what kind of change it is:

*   For a major feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so it can be discussed. This also allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplicate work, and help you craft the change so it is successfully accepted into the project.
*   Small features can be crafted and directly submitted as a pull request.
