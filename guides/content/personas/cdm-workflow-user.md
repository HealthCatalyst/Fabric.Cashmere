---

## Role

-   Daily User
-   Technical Level â€“Avg


---

## Responsibilities

-   Uses the product on a daily basis to perform the duties in her department
-   Uses email frequently for workflow and/or notifications


---

## Pain Points

-   If I can't find regulatory content in one place, it takes me a long time to track it down.
-   If I can't find my workflow tasks quickly, I might not work on the most important things.
-   When I enter incorrect information that breaks specific rules and don't catch them right away, then costs begin to add up quickly.
