# Katarina Virág

*"I have a big impact on the efficient flow in this organization. It’s rewarding, but when the tools I am using or other people slow me down, it can be stressful."*

<br>

When she gets to her office, Katarina reviews the patient schedule to see who is coming in. Katarina spends most of her day in the practice’s EHR system, reviewing patient records and documenting visits. Other tasks include cleaning/prepping equipment and explaining care regimens to patients. She’s tech savvy, using technology at home and work, and has years of experience using EHRs. She is frequently interrupted and distracted by the needs of the medical team and tries to focus as best she can on providing accurate patient documentation for her providers.
