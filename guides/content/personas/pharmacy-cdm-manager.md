## Role

-   Daily User
-   Technical Level â€“Avg

---

## Responsibilities

-   Uses the product on a daily basis and is accountable for the compliance of the Pharmacy CDM.
-   Is responsible for reducing revenue leakage in pharmacy in relation to the chargemaster.
-   Uses email frequently for workflow and/or notifications.

---

## Pain Points

-   I don't have visibility into the details of Willow, especially around billing so visibility into the formulary helps.
-   I am responsible for managing Pharmacy, but I am not a pharmacist so some of the complicated terminology is confusing and I don't fully understand drug dosage on a pharmacist level.
-   I am responsible for multiple parts of the CDM, so efficiency is important. I don't have time to really spend researching and need reports that are easily consumable.
