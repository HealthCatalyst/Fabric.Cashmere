## Goals

-   Develop custom ETL solutions
-   Quickly hand off my finished work to the downstream team waiting on me

---

## Needs

-   Ability to rename source system entities (tables, views, or files) and columns, create new source marts, map tables and columns, and deploy tables
-   Modify metadata connections with overridable and injectable extensibility points directly in SSMS
-   Keep track of my custom solutions so they don't cause breaking changes when the customer upgrades to a newer version of CAP
-   Refresh metadata, clone tables, get row counts, set up extensibility
-   Map source columns correctly so my work passes a peer review and script-based consistency checks (C4) built in SSMS
-   Understand what the features in Source Mart Designer do (I don't want to put a lot of thought into predicting what's going to happen)
-   Troubleshoot ETL failure by checking EDWAdmin tables
-   Jump to SSIS or create manual workarounds if a feature is missing (and seems unlikely to be added in the near future), has an architecture that is table based rather than column based, is unpredictable, or is less efficient than an external alternative (e.g., C4 queries, bulk renaming, Gap Analyzer)
-   Directly copy software code for use with multiple tools/applications
