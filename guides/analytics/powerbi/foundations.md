##### Typography

An effort should be made to adhere to Health Catalyst's [preferred typography](https://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/styles/typography)

### Segoe
*Because Power BI does not currently allow consistent access to font weights within object elements such as headers and sub-headers, the Segoe font family serves as the primary typeface. The default options within Power BI are Segoe UI, Segoe (Bold) and Segoe UI Light*

##### Icons
Icons should come from Health Catalyst's [icon set](https://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/styles/icons) and should be sized similarly to adjacent text.

##### Layout

General principles related to padding, headers, and spacing on the page

### Padding
Padding between objects should generally be 30 pixels wide. Padding within objects should be 4 pixels wide

### Alignment
Visuals should be evenly aligned horizontally and/or vertically <br>

Visuals should not be distributed unevenly <br>

Utilize Power BI's alignment capabilities by selecting each object and choosing the appropriate distribution option within the *Align* section under the *Format* toolbar <br>

### Spacing
The application name should be 5 pixels to the right of the tri-flame logo <br>

### Style
Visualization objects such as charts, graphs, tables, and KPIs should display a white border radius that is 5 pixels wide. Each object will also have an outside shadow position that is sized at 1 pixel with a blur factor of 5 pixels

Visualization objects should have a 1 pixel thin line below the header that spans the width of the object, leaving about 2 pixels of space before reaching either the left or right edges
