#####  Contributing to Cashmere

Before you submit your pull request (PR), consider the following guidelines:

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/HealthCatalyst/Fabric.Cashmere/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* Make your changes in a new Git branch. Here is a good [guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) if you're just getting started.
* Verify all changes look and function properly in different browsers and at different resolutions.
* Run the following commands:
  * `ng lint` should result in `All files pass linting`
  * `ng test` should result in `All tests passing`
  * `npm run build:lib` should pass and build the library successfully
* New components and directives must be accompanied by:
  * A component demonstrating the functionality; this component should be added to the demo app's routes
  * Unit tests demonstrating that it functions as intended
* A new component should adhere to the [Health Catalyst style](http://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net).
* "Squash and merge" a PR to complete it.
