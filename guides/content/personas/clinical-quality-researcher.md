### Researcher

Colin's primary go is to find insights into the healthcare system's populations so that teams can measure and intervene with that population. Unlike quality improvement, researchers have to abide by study protocol guidelines. He spends a fair amount of time reviewing and following these guidelines. Although researchers vary greatly in how level of comfort with technology, Colin tends to be less comfortable with computers (which is true of many researchers).

## Goals

-   Minimize exposure to patient information until institutional review board (IRB) approval
-   Look for insights to identify a cohort (during the pre-IRB exploratory phase)
-   Follow a cohort over time (throughout the study)
-   Ensure that he follows operating rules throughout the process
-   Clearly communicate data discoveries to domain SMEs and leaders
-   Find opportunities to improve care and outcomes (clinical, financial, operational) within his area of interest
-   Maintain focus on areas/outcomes of interest
-   Integrate latest domain research and clinician input into clinical analytics and tested hypotheses
-   Write research studies and presentations

## Needs

-   Understand and adhere to research protocols and regulatory laws (e.g., ability to export populations without PHI)
-   Access data and analytics (benchmarks, variation, trends) to identify care gaps, over- or under-utilization, areas of under-performance, etc.
-   Drill into specific cases to find enough details to investigate further, or link to where they can find that information
-   Access multiple tools to analyze, digest, and communicate information (Excel, BI visualization tool, etc.)
-   Access domain experts and appropriate clinical direction (e.g., part of domain intervention team to gather physician input, sign off on definitions and clinical direction, etc.)
-   Stay up-to-date on domain research and data
-   Access timely data
-   Measure outcomes of specific interventions over time (exactly what the hospital system is undertaking); this may include the ability to:
    -   Capture the date of intervention startâ€”and then track different metrics from that point (e.g., antibiotic compliance, mortality, etc.)
    -   Answer: Have we decreased variation and made significant difference in a specific metric, outcome, or process aim from target?
    -   Attribute the impact to the intervention
