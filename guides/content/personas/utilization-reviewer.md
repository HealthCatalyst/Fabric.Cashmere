## Pain Points

-   If I am unable to ensure that the hospital operates within the appropriate guidelines surround patient care, we can be audited and penalized thus impacting the organization's revenue & reputation.
-   If I am unable to find out the correct information needed to discharge, transfer, upgrade, or downgrade a patient, it can cause errors that affect patient care and delay important procedures for the patient.
-   If I am unable to know how long a patient has been in the hospital and how long they should stay in the hospital, it can cause errors in billing and patient care.
