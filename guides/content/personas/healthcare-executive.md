#### C-Suite Executive

This busy leader has historically relied on manual data capture for reporting (spreadsheets, etc.). However, she is comfortable with technology and data analysis—she’s used many different applications and analyzed domain-specific literature throughout her career. She has deep management and operations expertise. She is a primarily consumer of data, not a creator.

### Goals

- Demonstrate that the domain area program is viable (through ROI). This may include:
    - Looking for opportunities to improve margin by identifying and targeting inappropriate utilization
    - Looking for opportunities to increase reimbursement for care
- Optimize organizational performance in a strategic, balanced, and timely way
- Review the quality of her team’s work and coach/mentor her team by identifying and sharing best practices. Depending on the executive focus, this may include attention to:
    - Appropriate care and overuse
    - Effective operational or workflow management
    - Effective purchasing or revenue recognition
- Identify additional opportunities for managing patients, with regard to more optimal utilization pathways, more effective payer relationships, etc.
- Improve quality of patient care (improve outcomes)
- Decrease patient costs (optimize utilization)
- Improve the patient experience
- Increase provider engagement and experience

### Needs

-   Measure program or organizational performance—process and outcome measures, variation between staff (for reporting to leadership, identifying training needs, etc.)—and quickly identify meaningful changes
-   Insight into drivers of outcomes (positive or negative) and the ability to communicate clearly and credibly with others in the organization about the opportunity to improve performance (single source of truth)
-   Benchmark organizational performance against national standards or other organizations
-   Analyze the domain area population for problems and opportunities for improvement (for example, to reduce costs, improve care, reduce utilization, etc.)
-   Track costs trends over time and identify the root cause of changes in cost trends
-   Review specific patients to identify gaps in care related to domain area
