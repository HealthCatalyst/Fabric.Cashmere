# Stephanie Stina

*"I can't find any info on what this patient has had done to him in the past. I need a way to easily glean the patient’s story when I come on shift."*

<br>

Stephanie is responsible for coordinating the care of hospital patients with specialists, as well as communicating the plan of care to patients and family members. She is also responsible for documenting patient visits using templates in the EHR; placing orders and prescribing medications at discharge; reviewing incoming test results to determine a patient’s care plan; assessing when a specialist is needed and ordering those referrals/consultations; and recording billing information (as needed) to support the hospital’s billing department.

Stephanie is a good communicator with hospital staff and with patients and families. Despite the long hours and many responsibilities of her job, she feels that shift work as a hospitalist helps her maintain work-life balance.

## Goals

-   Provide high-quality hospital care, as aligned with the latest guideline standards, while keeping cost of care and length of stay low
-   Maintain high patient satisfaction by helping patients understand their illness/injury and achieve the medical goals set for them during their hospital stay
-   Intervene with critical patients early and rapidly
-   Recognize end of life; provide comfort care when applicable and discuss situations when care is doing more harm than good for the patient
-   Complete required paperwork and electronic documentation more efficiently so that she can spend more time interacting with patients on a personal level
-   Work better with the hospital staff and clinical care team, e.g., increase their trust and confidence in medical decision making and follow-up

## Needs

-   Ability to respond to multiple urgent matters at the same time
-   Quickly review all necessary data (not much time is allowed per patient)
-   Ability to easily identify the trouble areas to prioritize during the visit
-   Visibility into the patient’s past medical history (e.g., procedures and diagnoses from the last three years) to increase confidence when making treatment decisions
-   Efficient means of communication with other providers to prevent delays in consultant or specialist follow up
-   Focus on interactions with patients—not the EMR
-   Timely notifications when new patients are admitted
