This directory contains the Angular CLI project files used in the StackBlitz. For the most part, you should not need to edit files in this directory.

Two exceptions worth noting:
- `styles.scss` contains global styles for the examples, there may be occasion to add these occasionally
- `package.json` tweak this if it is determined that a particular third-party library should be preoloaded for a stackblitz example
