---

## Role

-   Daily User
-   Technical Level â€“ High

---

## Responsibilities

-   Manages admin rights
-   Reviews revenue at an account level
-   Works with employees to identify workflow opportunities
-   Work stream to ensure the executive cash flow is constant

---

## Pain Points

-   If I am unable to keep the organization fiscally secure by maintaining cash flow and improving revenue the hospital could have to close its doors.
-   I am interrupted frequently.
-   When I am unable to see the levels of efficiency in our workflow process, I cannot make changes to assure revenue comes in the door as soon as possible.
-   When I don't have a robust reporting tool, I am unable to determine if additional revenue could be obtained or whether we are out of compliance with rules and regulations.
-   I need to affect some basic settings (workflow creation) to be able to involve others within the organization (Admin Tools) or I will have to rely on the vendor who might not make the changes in the timeline I need.
