##### Angular Component
``` html
<hc-breadcrumbs></hc-breadcrumbs>
```

:::
##### Router Setup
> The `hc-breadcrumb` component makes use of the angular `Router` with the scope of the routing module in which it is placed.  A custom data element named `breadcrumb` must be added to its Routes in order for the breadcrumb component to function properly.  Below in an example of a properly configured Route:
``` json
{
    path: 'breadcrumbs',
    component: BreadcrumbsDemoComponent,
    data: { breadcrumb: "Home Page" },
    children: [
        {
            path: 'breadcrumb1',
            component: Breadcrumb1DemoComponent,
            data: { breadcrumb: "Second Page" }
        }
    ]
}
```
