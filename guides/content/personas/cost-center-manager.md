### Accountant, Cost Manager, Service-Line Manager/Program Director, Lead Physician, Nursing Lead

Paige has financial accountability for her department and reports to her manager on the operations and financial stability of her department. She has deep subject-matter expertise for her area and works with the [Cost Analyst/Accountant](/content/personas/cost-management-director) to integrate that expertise into the healthcare system's cost accounting. She has deep analytical savvy, but she isn't technically savvy.
