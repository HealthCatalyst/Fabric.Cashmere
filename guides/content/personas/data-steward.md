The data steward takes the lead in the identification of operational and business intelligence data requirements; ensures the quality of data names, business definitions, and business values; may be responsible for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and conformance with internal data policies and data access standards; and ensures appropriate security controls, analyzes and improves data quality, and identifies and resolves data-related issues.

## Goals

-   Understanding of user personas/what access various users need (e.g., if users need access to different regions, patient data, application tabs, etc.)
-   Perform regular audits of user access and terminate access of individuals or groups who no longer need access to perform their work (e.g., role change, attrition, etc.)
-   Troubleshoot access issues in a timely manner
-   Assure data integrity through visibility into refresh times, row counts, and other data quality measures
-   Organize data validation training for staff and data extraction personnel to improve data integrity

## Needs

-   User access transparency surfaced within the application (ideally), including HR data (role changes, attrition, new hires, etc.) and usage statistics
-   Apply security profiles based on user categories or user personas
-   Enter, receive, and respond to support tickets (preferably through the app)
-   Admin tab(s) with data integrity measures highlighting potential problems and with validation tracking
-   View and edit metric, cohort, terminology, etc., definitions within the app
