## Role

-   Frequency of Use
-   Technical Level â€“ High




---

## Responsibilities

-   Performs setup of accounts (users, defaults, etc.)
-   Defines workflow within the product
-   Performs setup of SFTP and auto file submission




---

## Pain Points

-   Optimal performance of SFTP
-   Not getting the results as promised from the API and having to adapt via workaround measures, which takes time with no guaranteed solutions.
-   If I am unable to get adequate implementation and documentation, then major errors can occur in regard to product setup thus causing major delays in implementation.
