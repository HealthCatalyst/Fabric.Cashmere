## Needs

-   Access data and analytics (benchmarks, variation, trends)  to identify care gaps, over- or under-utilization, areas of under-performance, etc.
-   Drill into specific cases to find enough details to investigate further, or link to where they can find that information
-   Access multiple tools to analyze, digest, and communicate information (Excel, BI visualization tool, etc.)
-   Access domain experts and appropriate clinical direction (e.g., part of domain intervention team to gather physician input, sign off on definitions and clinical direction, etc.)
-   Stay up-to-date on domain research and data
-   *For process improvement work:* Access timely data
-   *For process improvement work:* Measure outcomes of specific interventions over time (exactly what the hospital system is undertaking); this may include the ability to:
    -   Capture the date of intervention start—and then track different metrics from that point (e.g., antibiotic compliance, mortality, etc.)
    -   Answer: Have we decreased variation and made significant difference in a specific metric, outcome, or process aim from target?
    -   Attribute the impact to the intervention
