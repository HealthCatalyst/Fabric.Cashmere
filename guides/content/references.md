##### Purpose and Scope

The Health Catalyst Editorial Stylebook defines the standards for how we write, edit, and publish content. It ensures our brand voice remains credible, precise, and human across all channels(—)from thought leadership articles and technical papers to marketing collateral.

**Applies to:**

This guide applies to all **externally published content**, including:

-   Website content ([Insights](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/learn/insights), [White Papers](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/learn/white-papers), [Executive Briefs,
    Playbooks](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/learn/ebooks))
-   [Newsroom articles](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/newsroom) and press releases
-   Marketing and client communications
-   Emails

**Internal communications** should follow these principles, when possible, but may take a more conversational tone.

##### Updates and Feedback

The **Editorial Committee** will review and update this guide **quarterly**.

##### Voice and Tone

Our voice reflects **trusted healthcare expertise, clarity, and compassion**. We are advisors and thought partners, not vendors or technology provider.

&nbsp;

| **Attribute** | **Description** | **Example** | **What it is Not** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Trusted**  | Confident and factual, not promotional. | "Data is only as powerful as the action it inspires." | Passive
| **Empathetic**  | People-first, human-centered. | "Behind every metric is a patient, a provider, or a family." | Mechanical
| **Analytical**  | Grounded in data and evidence. | "Predictive analytics can identify risk before costs escalate." | Pedantic
| **Optimistic**  | Forward-looking and solutions-oriented. | "Transformation is Defensive achievable---and measurable." | Defensive

&nbsp;

**Tone flexes by audience:**
- **Executives:** strategic and outcomes-driven.
- **Clinicians:** collaborative and evidence-based.
- **Technical audiences:** precise and explanatory.

##### Mechanics and Grammar

- Follow [AP Style](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/journalism_and_journalistic_writing/ap_style.html) as the primary reference for grammar, punctuation, and usage in articles, blog posts, and other public-facing materials.
- When AP Style does **not address a specific situation** (such as references, statistical reporting, or data presentation), follow **APA Style (7th edition)**.
- Apply **Health Catalyst-specific exceptions** listed below (or in Cashmere) to ensure consistency across all formats:

**Common exceptions:**

- **Oxford comma:** Always use.
- **Healthcare:** One word.
- **Percent:** Use "%" in tables/graphics and running text/copy.
- **Numbers:** Spell out one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above.
- **Dates:** Use full month/day/year (e.g., October 30, 2025).
- **Times:** Use numerals (e.g., 10:30 AM).
- **Titles:** Capitalize according to the guidelines below.

:::

:::

##### Titles and Headings

- Use **title case** for titles and subheads.
- Capitalize: All nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverb.
- Prepositions of five or more letters.

Example: *Driving Improvement Through Data and Insight*

- Use **sentence case** for figure titles, image captions, and callouts.

Example: *Our approach bridges financial and clinical priorities.*

**Formatting tips:**
- Headlines should be under **70 characters**.
- Use an **em dash (--)** for contrast or emphasis in subheads.

Example: *Margin Pressure Is Rising--Visibility Is Non-Negotiable.*

:::

:::

##### Punctuation and Formatting

**Em Dash (—)**
- No spaces before or after.
- Use sparingly for emphasis.

**En Dash (-)**
- Use for numeric ranges (e.g., 10--20%).
 
**Lists and Bullet Points**
- Begin each item with a capital letter.
- End all bullet points with a period when each item is a complete sentence.
- Use no punctuation for fragmented bullets.
- Caveat: Punctuation usage for bullets may fluctuate when in presentation decks.

**Example:**
Health Catalyst enables organizations to:
- Improve operational efficiency.
- Advance patient outcomes.
- Build financial resilience.

**Formatting Standards**

&nbsp;

| Element | Rule | Example |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Dates  | Spell out months  | October 15, 2025 |
| Times  | Include full range and, if adding time zone, abbreviate | 1:00 -- 2:00 PM CST |
| Numbers  | Spell one through nine | Three solutions; 15 FTEs |
| Percentages  |  "%" in copy and graphics | 10% improvement |
| URLs  | Drop https:// and www | healthcatalyst.com |

##### Brand and Legal

**Trademarks**

Always apply marks on **first use only** in a document. Consult [Trademark Usage on Cashmere](https://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/content/trademarks).

Examples:
- *Hospital Price Index™ enables hospital price transparency.*
- *Health Catalyst Ignite™ powers enterprise analytics.*

**Abbreviations**

- Consult [Abbreviations and Common Terms on Cashmere](https://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/content/usage) for approved shorthand and usage. For instance, don't spell out on first reference the following: EHR, ACO.
- Use acronyms only after first reference unless it's a universally recognized acronym (e.g., CMS, FDA, CDC). Spell out in citations/references.

**Product Names**

- Capitalize official Health Catalyst product names; lowercase generic references (e.g., data platform).
- Use marks as adjectives, not nouns. Example:
   - Correct: The PowerCosting^TM^ solution enables financial transparency.\
   - Incorrect: Health Catalyst Ignite ^TM^ powers enterprise analytics.

**Copyright**

- Cite sources when quoting or referencing data.\
- Example: *Source: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).*\
- Include copyright attribution for any reused figures or tables.

##### Research and Credibility (References & Citations)

Cite a source whenever you include a statistic, number, or claim. Our goal is to ensure accuracy, credibility, and transparency in all materials.

**Preferred Sources**

- Government (.gov), academic (.edu), or reputable nonprofit (.org) sources (e.g., CMS, NIH, AHRQ.
- Peer-reviewed journals or major media outlets known for fact-based reporting (e.g., Modern Healthcare, Becker's Hospital Review, Fierce Healthcare).
- Subscription or proprietary data (e.g., Gartner, The Advisory Board): These often restrict use. Check the terms of use or contact the Communications team or [Brooke MacCourtney,](mailto:mail:%20brooke.maccourtney@healthcatalyst.com) customer marketing manager, before publishing. Use third-party analyst sources to illustrate trends. When in doubt, paraphrase broad themes and omit exact figures unless the source explicitly allows public citation.

**Avoid**

- Vendor websites, promotional blogs, or any source with commercial interest.

**Formatting**

- Use hyperlinks for digital content (e.g., *according to CMS*).
- Hyperlink the organization name or publication name.

**Recency and Accuracy**

- Always verify that data is current and from the primary, authoritative source.
- Avoid citing outdated or archived information, where possible.

**Anonymizing Organizations**

- Do not use organizational names in anecdotes unless it corresponds with a published [success story](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/knowledge-center/success-stories/) or a study in a peer-reviewed journal you can link to. - Example: Instead of, "A patient safety initiative at Brigham and Women's Hospital...," it's, "A patient safety initiative at an academic medical center..."

##### Inclusive and Ethical Language

- Use person-first language (e.g., *people with diabetes*, not *diabetics*).
- Avoid stigmatizing or emotionally charged terms.
- Write in gender-neutral language unless context demands specificity.
- Represent diversity accurately in examples and imagery.
