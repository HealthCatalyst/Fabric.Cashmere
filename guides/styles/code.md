##### Code Font

Display source code in a monospace font. The Cashmere site uses the following: `font-family: Consolas, Menlo, "Ubuntu Mono", monospace;`

##### Code Blocks

Include line numbers for blocks of code longer than than three lines. Line numbers should be:

*   The same font size as the code
*   In a light gray color so they aren't distracting

```html
<hc-list>
    <hc-list-item>
        <hc-icon fontSet="fa" fontIcon="fa-snowflake-o" hcListIcon></hc-icon>
        <h4 hcListLine>SnowFlake</h4>
        <span hcListLine>Second Line</span>
    </hc-list-item>
</hc-list>
```

##### Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting makes blocks of code more readable. The **"GitHub Gist"** theme in the highlight.js library is our recommended highlighter. Visit [https://highlightjs.org/static/demo](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo) for details.
